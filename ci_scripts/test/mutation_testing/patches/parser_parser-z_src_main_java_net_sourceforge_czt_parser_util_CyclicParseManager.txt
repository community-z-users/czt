/**
 * <p>
 * A manager to resolve cyclic parent paths during the parsing process. It is stateful
 * and should be used during the parsing process. When the sections have already been
 * parsed, resolving cyclic parents should be done using methods in 
 * {@link SectParentResolver} class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is used together with a {@link SectionInfo} section manager, to which
 * the manager attaches itself. This allows keeping the state during the parsing
 * of sections, as long as the same section manager is used. Use static method 
 * {@link #getManager(SectionInfo)} to retrieve the instance of the cyclic parents 
 * manager for the given section manager. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The manager tracks "active" sections during parent section calls of the parsing 
 * process. Then, if an already "active" section is reached again, the manager
 * filters it out, essentially "cutting" the cycle at that point.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if the cycle is of sections "A &rarr; B &rarr; C &rarr; A", before
 * section A calls to parent section B for its info tables (and thus parsing), section
 * A is marked "active". Because B is not active yet, parser is allowed to go parsing
 * section B. Now before B calls parent C, it is marked "active", and so on. Eventually,
 * we arrive when parsing section C, we are about to call for parsing of section 
 * A&mdash;which will get us into the loop. However, the "active" sections stack at this
 * point is "A, B, C", so A is already "active". Thus the algorithm excludes A from the
 * valid parent list, and C appears to the parser as having no parents at all. At this
 * point, we have "cut" the cycle. Without any parents to process, C marks itself "inactive".
 * C finishes parsing (maybe with errors, because it was relying on something in A) and 
 * the call returns to B. Now it makes itself "inactive", and so on. Finally, A resolves
 * its parents, is marked "inactive" and finishes parsing itself.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The algorithm relies on all parent calls during the parsing process using this manager.
 * All parent calls must be encapsulated by the pair of 
 * {@link #getValidParentNames(String, List)} and {@link #visitedParents(String)}, to
 * ensure correct "activation/deactivation" of sections. Note that 
 * {@link #getValidParents(String, List)} can be used for convenience instead of
 * {@link #getValidParentNames(String, List)}.
