# CI Scripts

This directory contains scripts that the CI workflow uses. There are also some
miscellaneous scripts and directories used in the development and evaluation of
test case prioritisation sytems. The work in this folder was conducted by
Samuel Valery as a part of a thesis project on implementing a DevOps system
for the CZT project. Please contact <samuel.valery@hotmail.com> for details
regarding the code in this directory.

## Build
The build directory contains two scripts that the CI workflow executes to build
the CZT project and evaluate the outcome of the build.

## Dependency Tree
During development of a 'Module Based TCP' System, a tool was created to
generate a graphical representation of the dependencies between modules in the
CZT project.

## Test
The test directory contains four implemented test case prioritisation (TCP)
systems and mutation testing output used to evaluate the TCP systems. Further
details are included in the README's for each TCP system.
