Welcome to gnast
----------------

Gnast is a java code-generator responsible for generating the AST
classes and interfaces for the CZT project.  Gnast itself is also
part of the CZT project.

For more information, please have a look in the doc/ directory, as
well as the CZT web site
http://czt.sourceforge.net/

Here is a description of what each of the top level directories
contains:

build/      This is a temporary build directory.
doc/        This is where the documentation lives.
src/        This is where all of the source code lives.
            
Requirements
************

- Java 2 SDK 1.4
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/
- Ant
  http://ant.apache.org/
- XalanJ 2.5.0
  http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/
- Velocity
  http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/

are required to build and use gnast.

If you don't have one of these installed on your system,
you must download and install it to compile the software.

Make sure that ant, java, and javac are in your search path,
and set the properties xalan.home and velocity.home in the
file build.properties to the home directory of your installations.

Compile and Run
***************
Change to the directory where this file is in, and call
 > ant
By default, ant will build a jar file.  To run the code generator,
check the settings in gnast.properties and call
 > ant run
Note that you need files from package corejava to compile and
run the generated code.
The easiest way to achieve this is to get and unpack the corejava
package, set the destination directory (property dest.dir in
gnast.properties or command line option -d) to the src directory
of the corejava package and run the code generator. The code generator
will overwrite the newly created classes.

WARNING: THE CODE GENERATOR WILL OVERWRITE FILES IN THE DIRECTORY
SPECIFIED VIA dest.dir IN THE gnast.properties FILE OR PER COMMAND
LINE WITH -d WITHOUT ASKING.

Optionally, you can pass one of the following build targets as an
argument to Ant:

	api	- builds the API documentation
	clean	- removes all files generated by build targets
	compile - compiles the code generator but does not build the jar
	jar	- builds the jar
	run	- runs the code generator using the settings
		  in gnast.properties
