Welcome to gnast
----------------

Gnast is a java code-generator responsible for generating the AST
classes and interfaces of the CZT project.  Gnast itself is also
part of the CZT project.

For more information, please have a look in the doc/ directory, as
well as the CZT web site
http://czt.sourceforge.net/

Here is a description of what each of the top level directories
contains:

build/      This is a temporary build directory.
doc/        This is where the documentation lives.
src/        This is where all of the source code lives.
tests/      This is where all of the tests live.
            
Requirements
************

- Java 2 SDK 1.4
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/
- Ant
  http://ant.apache.org/
- XalanJ 2.5.0
  http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/
- Velocity
  http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/

are required to build and use gnast.

If you don't have one of these installed on your system,
you must download and install it to compile the software.

Make sure that ant, java, and javac are in your search path,
and set the properties xalan.home and velocity.home in the
file build.properties to the home directory of your installations.

Compile and Run
***************
Change to the directory where this file is in, and call ant.
By default, ant will build a jar file and then run the code generator.

WARNING: THE CODE GENERATOR WILL OVERWRITE FILES IN THE DIRECTORY
SPECIFIED VIA dest.dir IN THE gnast.properties FILE OR PER COMMAND
LINE WITH -d WITHOUT ASKING.

Optionally, you can pass one of the following build targets as an
argument to Ant:

         jar          - builds the jar
         api          - builds the API documentation
         clean        - removes all files generated by build targets
