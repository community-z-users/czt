              Compiling and installing CZT
             ------------------------------

Compiling CZT

  You need at least the following:

  * SVN installed (e.g., Windows has Tortoise; others it's native)

  * {{{http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/} J2SE Development Kit >= 6}}

  * {{{http://maven.apache.org/} Maven version >= 2.0.4}}

  []

  to build CZT.  If you don't have these installed on your system,
  you should download and install them before you can build CZT.
  Maven will download all other dependencies automatically.

  You also need to increase the Java heap size to at least 256Mb,
  which is done by setting the <<<MAVEN_OPTS>>> environment variable
  to at least <<<-Xmx256m>>>.  Recommended settings are 
  <<<-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m>>>.  Then change into the 
  <<<CZT_HOME>>> directory, and call
  
  i.e., export these variables to your environment (e.g., Unix format)
  
		MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
      	JAVA_HOME=$HOME/java  			[don't include the /bin directory!]
      	PATH=$PATH:$HOME/maven/bin		[include the /bin directory!]
  
  i.e., acquire the sources from svn
  		svn checkout https://czt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/czt/trunk


  i.e., cd to the place where the svn repository 
  		mvn clean install
  		
  i.e., partial builds (e.g., builds from PROJECT-NAME onwards)
  		mvn -rf PROJECT-NAME clean install

+---------------------+
  mvn clean install
+---------------------+

  This should compile, test, package, and install all the CZT tools into
  your local maven repository, ready to be used in your own projects.

  Occasionally, maven reports an error while downloading one of the
  various dependencies.  This is typically a timeout and rerunning the
  build and letting maven pick up where it left off is usually
  sufficient (you might need to do this several times).  You might also
  try to configure a more reliable mirror closer to you; see
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html}
  the maven documenation}} on how to configure a maven mirror.

  Running the CZT tests takes quite a long time.  If you want to skip
  running the unit tests call

+------------------------------------------+
  mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true 
+------------------------------------------+

  instead.

  See README.txt for information on how to use CZT.


--- Step by step 

====================== On Windows 7 (Feb 2012) =====================

a) installed tortoise svn - http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html
b) installed java jdk     - http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/7u2-b13/jdk-7u2-windows-i586.exe
c) installed maven 		  - http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/maven/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.zip\
d) added environment variables above on the user vars (not system-wide)
	MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
    JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7" 		[add the quotes!!! program files name is long]
    PATH=%PATH%;c:\maven\bin
f) started cmd.exe (command) prompt: 
	cd \
	mkdir czt
	cd czt 
	svn checkout https://czt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/czt/trunk
	mvn clean install
g) done

====================== On Mac OS X (Lion) (Feb 2012) =====================

a) svn is native
b) hit java on prompt it installs Java for Mac for you
c) maven was already on as well - or just install as above
d) added environment variables above on the user vars (not system-wide) (e.g., used export VAR=VALUE)
	MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
e) started terminal
	cd $HOME
	mkdir czt
	cd czt
	svn checkout https://czt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/czt/trunk
	mvn clean install
g) done
