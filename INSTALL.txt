                  Compiling and installing CZT
                  ============================

You need at least the following:
- J2SE Development Kit >= 5.0
  http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/
- Maven version >= 2.0.4
  http://maven.apache.org/
to build CZT.  If you don't have these installed on your system,
you should download and install them before you can build czt.
Maven will download all other dependencies automatically.

To build CZT, you need to increase the Java heap size to at least
256Mb, which is done by setting the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable
to "-Xmx256m".  Then change into the <CZT_HOME> directory, and call
  mvn install
This should compile, test, package, and install all the CZT tools into
your local maven repository, ready to be used in your own projects.
Running the CZT tests takes quite a long time.  If you want to skip
running the unit tests call
  mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install
instead.

See also README.txt for information how to use CZT.
