                  Compiling and installing CZT
                  ============================

You need at least the following:
- J2SE Development Kit >= 6
  http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/
- Maven version >= 2.0.4
  http://maven.apache.org/
to build CZT.  If you don't have these installed on your system,
you should download and install them before you can build czt.
Maven will download all other dependencies automatically.

To build CZT, you need to increase the Java heap size to at least
256Mb, which is done by setting the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable
to "-Xmx256m".  Then change into the <CZT_HOME> directory, and call
  mvn clean install
This should compile, test, package, and install all the CZT tools into
your local maven repository, ready to be used in your own projects.

Occasionally, maven reports an error while downloading one of the
various dependencies.  This is typically a timeout and rerunning the
build and letting maven pick up where it left off is usually
sufficient (you might need to do this several times).  You might also
try to configure a more reliable mirror closer to you; see
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html
on how to configure a maven mirror.

Running the CZT tests takes quite a long time.  If you want to skip
running the unit tests call
  mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install
instead.

See also README.txt for information how to use CZT.
