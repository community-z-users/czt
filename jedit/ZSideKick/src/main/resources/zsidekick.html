<h1>ZSideKick plugin user's guide</h1>

<h3>by Petra Malik and Mark Utting</h3>

<p>
  The ZSideKick plugin is an extension of the SideKick plugin (see its
  documentation as well) that allows Z and Object Z specifications to
  be parsed and typechecked automatically.  Any errors found are
  reported to the ErrorList plugin, which means that they are
  displayed in the ErrorList plugin window and highlighted in the text
  area.  Also supported are the selection of well formed formulae and
  actions based on this selection like, for example, jumping to the
  definition of a referencing name.  The plugin currently supports two
  markup formats for Z and Object Z: the LaTeX markup and the Unicode
  markup.
</p>

<p>
  The ZSideKick plugin shares its view with other SideKick plugins
  through the SideKick Structure Browser.  It is most convenient to
  dock the Structure Browser on the left or right.  In the Structure
  Browser, a tree view for the sections and paragraphs of a Z or
  Object Z specification is shown.  A mouse click on one of the nodes
  in the tree will highlight the line in the jEdit buffer where that
  item begins.  Shift-click on a node will select that node in the
  buffer.  The tree will also follow the cursor in the buffer, that
  is, the selected node in the tree will change depending on the
  cursor position.
</p>

<p>
  The parser used for a particular buffer depends on the mode.  By
  default, the Unicode Z parser is associated to a mode called "z",
  the Unicode Object Z parser to "oz", the LaTeX Z parser to "zlatex",
  and the LaTeX Object Z parser to "ozlatex".  These associations can
  be customised in the SideKick options.  It is also possible to
  associate files or file endings to particular modes.  See the jEdit
  documentation on how to install edit modes for more information
  about this.
