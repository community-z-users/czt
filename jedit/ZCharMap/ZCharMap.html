<h1>Community Z Tools</h1>

<h3>by Petra Malik</h3>

<p>
  The Community Z Tools plugin displays a dockable window listing
  important Z characters and Z constructs.  By clicking on them, the
  corresponding markup can be insted into the current buffer.  The
  markup can be selected with the combo box at the left top corner.
  Currently supported are Unicode and LaTeX markup.
</p>

<p>
  The "Typecheck" button parses and typechecks the file in the current
  buffer (don't forget to save first since the file, not the buffer
  content, is used).  The result is displayed in the jEdit status bar,
  errors with line and column number information can be viewed using
  the ErrorList plugin.
</p>

<p>
  The specification can be converted to Unicode (LaTeX) if LaTeX
  markup (Unicode) is choosen, or can be translated into ZML (XML
  markup for Z).  If parsing and translating was successful, a new
  buffer containing the output of the conversion is opened.  In case
  of an error, the error list can be consulted.
