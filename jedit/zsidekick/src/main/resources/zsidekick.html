<h1>ZSideKick plugin user's guide</h1>

<h3>by Petra Malik and Mark Utting</h3>

<p>
  The ZSideKick plugin is an extension of the SideKick plugin (see its
  documentation as well) that allows Z and Object Z specifications to
  be parsed and typechecked automatically.  Any errors found are
  reported to the ErrorList plugin, which means that they are
  displayed in the ErrorList plugin window and highlighted in the text
  area.  Also supported are the selection of well formed formulae and
  actions based on this selection like jumping to the definition of a
  referencing name.
</p>

<p>
  The ZSideKick plugin shares its view with other SideKick plugins
  through the SideKick Structure Browser.  It is most convenient to
  dock the Structure Browser on the left or right.  In the Structure
  Browser, a tree view for the sections and paragraphs of a
  specification is shown.  A mouse click on one of the nodes in the
  tree will highlight the line in the jEdit buffer where that item
  begins.  Shift-click on a node will select that node in the buffer.
  The tree will also follow the cursor in the buffer, that is, the
  selected node in the tree will change depending on the cursor
  position.
</p>

<p>
  The parser used for a particular buffer depends on the mode.  By
  default, the Unicode Z parser is associated to a mode called "z",
  the Unicode Object Z parser to "oz", the Unicode Circus parser to
  "circus", the LaTeX Z parser to "zlatex", the LaTeX Object Z parser
  to "ozlatex", and the LaTeX Circus parser to "circuslatex".  These
  associations can be customised in the SideKick options dialog.  It
  is also possible to associate files or file endings to particular
  modes by modifying the jEdit catalog file.  See the jEdit
  documentation on how to install edit modes for more information
  about this.
