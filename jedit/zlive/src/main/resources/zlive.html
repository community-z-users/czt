<h1>ZLive plugin user's guide</h1>

<h3>by Petra Malik and Mark Utting</h3>

<p>
  The ZLive plugin is an embedding of ZLive, a Z animator for Z, in
  the jEdit Console plugin (see its documentation as well).  This
  documentation assumes that you are familiar with ZLive and only
  describes the integration between jEdit and ZLive.
</p>

<p>
  The ZLive plugin is an extension of the Console and ZSideKick
  plugin, so these plugins must be installed as well in order to be
  able to use it.  The ZLive plugin can be accessed by starting the
  Console plugin and choosing the zlive shell from the drop-down list
  at the top left corner of the Console plugin interface.  ZLive
  commands can now be typed into the textfield provided by the Console
  plugin interface.  When the Enter key or "Run" button is pressed,
  the given command is interpreted by ZLive and the result is printed
  in the Console window.
