<h1>ZCharMap plugin user's guide</h1>

<h3>by Petra Malik and Mark Utting</h3>

<p>
  The ZCharMap plugin displays a dockable window listing
  important Z characters and Z constructs.  The plugin currently
  supports two markup formats for Z: the LaTeX markup and the Unicode
  markup.
</p>

<p>You can simply click on a Z character or construct to insert it
  into your current buffer.
  The top line ("Paragraphs") inserts complete Z paragraphs, with
  uppercase placeholders for the parts that you should fill in,
  while most of the other constructs insert just one Z symbol
  or operator.  For example, clicking on "Sch[]", with LaTeX
  markup selected, will insert a
  <em>generic schema</em> construct, like this:
<pre>
  \begin{schema}{NAME}[ TYPE ]
    DECLS
  \where
    PREDS
  \end{schema}
</pre> 
  You should replace NAME by the name of your schema, TYPE by
  the generic type parameter(s), DECLS by a sequence of declarations
  and PREDS by a sequence of predicates.
</p>

<p><b>Hints:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>To write the name of a primed variable, like <code>x'</code>,
        use the <code>'</code> character from the "Schemas" line of
        the CZT plugin.  (In LaTeX, this just inserts the normal ASCII
        prime character, but in Unicode it inserts a special prime
        symbol.  To prime a schema or expression, you must put a
        space inbetween the schema name and the prime.  This space
        must be a normal space character in Unicode markup, but a special
        spacing command like tilde (<code>~</code>) in LaTeX markup.</li>

    <li>In LaTeX markup, you must write underscores as <code>\_</code>,
        newlines as <code>\\</code> and spaces as <code>~</code>.  
        In Unicode markup these can just be written as normal
        ASCII characters.</li>

    <li>To enter subscripts within a name, use the "subscript-1" construct
	at the end of the "Schemas" line.  This can also be used to
        convert "exists" into "exists-unique", or "nat" into "nat_1" etc.

    <li>To enter superscripts within a name, use the "Transitive Closure"
        construct from the "Relations" line, then replace the <code>+</code>
        by the superscript that you want.
    <li>Be careful to distinguish between some pairs of operators that
	look quite similar:
	<ul>
	  <li>Binary subtraction (long minus) 
              versus unary negation (short minus).</li>
	  <li>Set subtraction looks like a normal backslash (<code>\</code>)
              but is different (it is bolder and more sloped).  The schema
	      hiding operator is also visually similar, but is even larger
	      and bolder.</li>
	  <li>The union and intersection operators come in a small binary
	      version (for "a union b") as well as a large distributed
              version (for "union S", where S is a set of sets).</li>
          <li>The "Relational Inverse" operator looks like a normal
	      ASCII tilde, except that it is higher.</li>
          <li>Z uses three different semicolon characters!  
              The normal ASCII semicolon
              can be used as a separator between declarations, or as
	      a separator between predicates.  A larger semicolon
	      with holes in it is used for composition of two relations
	      (see the "Relations" line of the CZT plugin).
	      A huge bold semicolon with holes in it is used for
	      sequential composition of schemas (see the "Schemas"
	      line of the CZT plugin).</li>
	</ul>
  </ul>
