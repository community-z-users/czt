<h1>Z/EVES plugin user's guide</h1>

<h3>by Leo Freitas</h3>

<p>
  The Z/EVES plugin is an embedding of Z/EVES, a Z theorem prover for Z, in
  the jEdit Console plugin (see its documentation as well).  This
  documentation assumes that you are familiar with Z/EVES command line and only
  describes the integration between jEdit and Z/EVES.
</p>

<p>
  The Z/EVES plugin is an extension of the Console and ZSideKick
  plugin, so these plugins must be installed as well in order to be
  able to use it.  The Z/EVES plugin can be accessed by starting the
  Console plugin and choosing the zeves shell from the drop-down list
  at the top left corner of the Console plugin interface.  Z/EVES
  commands can now be typed into the text field provided by the Console
  plugin interface.  When the Enter key or "Run" button is pressed,
  the given command is interpreted by Z/EVES and the result is printed
  in the Console window.
