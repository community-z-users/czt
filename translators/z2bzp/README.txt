Translator from Z to BZP (the input syntax of the BZ-TT tools).

BZ-TT (BZ Testing Tools) is a suite of tools for animating and
generating tests from formal specifications.  The BZP input syntax
is a Prolog-readable file which defines the constants, state variables 
and invariant predicates of a machine, plus its operations (inputs, 
outputs and preconditions and postconditions).  See the following
websites for more details and publications:
