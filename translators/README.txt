This directory contains translators from Z into other languages/notations.


z2b: From Z into B -- this translates a single Z section into a
    B abstract machine.  This provides access to the B refinement and
    proof tools, and also gives a way of using Z specifications with
    the BZ Testing Tools (BZ-TT), for test generation.

zml2xhtml: From Z into HTML, via XSLT style sheets.  This allows
    Z specifications to be viewed using a standard web browser
    (it must use an appropriate Unicode font to view all the Z symbols).

z2svg: From Z into SVG.  For browsing the well-formed formulae of
    a Z specification using a standard web browser with SVG plug-in.
