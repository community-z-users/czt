      <p>
      There are not many screenshots yet, because we are still
      working on the core Java libraries and have not yet done much
      GUI development.
      <p>
      However, here is a view of a preliminary version of the
      Z unicode editor, which is built as a Z mode and plugin to
      the <a href="http://www.jedit.org">JEdit open-source editor</a>.
