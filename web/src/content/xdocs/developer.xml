      <title>General remarks</title>
      <p>
        When you want to contribute, it is best to start from the sources
        from CVS.  See the
        <link href="site:cztcvsinfo">
          documentation about CVS on sourceforge
        </link>
        for more information about how to access the CZT repository.

    <section>
      <title>Starting a new subproject</title>
      <p>
        Each subproject of CZT is located in its own subdirectory.
        To start a new subproject, say
        <code>Foo</code>,
        add a new directory <code>foo</code> into the root
        of the CVS tree.  The structure within the new directory,
        should be as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>README.txt</code>
          --- the README file containing information about
          the subproject (prerequisites, how to build it, how to run
          it, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>build.xml</code>
          --- the ant build file
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>build</code>
          --- this is a temporary build directory
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>doc</code>
          --- this is the directory where the documentation lives
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>examples</code>
          --- this is the directory where examples live
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>src</code>
          --- this is the directory where the source code live
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>tests</code>
          --- this is the directory where the tests live
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Writing an ant build file</title>
      <p>
        Ant build files are called
        <code>build.xml</code> and should use the following target names:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          clean
          --- clean up
        </li>
        <li>
          compile
          --- compile the sources
        </li>
        <li>
          doc
          --- build the documentation
        </li>
        <li>
          install
          --- build the jar files and copy it into the CVSROOT/lib directory
        </li>
        <li>
          run
          --- run the application
        </li>
        <li>
          test
          --- compile and run the tests
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Properties that may be set by the user
        should be set in
        <code>czt.properties</code>,
        which is located in the root of the CVS tree, and read
        via <code>&lt;property file="../czt.properties"/&gt;</code>.
        Build files must not rely on environmental variables to
        work properly.
      </p>
