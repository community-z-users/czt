# CZT verification condition generators

CZT provides classes for creating VCs for Z and some Z extensions.

To provide modularity, each supported dialect gets its own VCG subproject.
For your projects, select VCGs just for the dialects you need as your dependencies:

-   [**Z** (core): `vcg-z`]( vcg-z/ )
-   [**Z/EVES** extension: `vcg-zeves`]( vcg-zeves/ )
-   [**Circus** extension: `vcg-circus`]( vcg-circus/ )
