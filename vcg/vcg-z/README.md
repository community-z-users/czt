# Verification condition generator for Z

The CZT verification condition generator supports generating conjectures about Z specifications
used to verify their correctness and consistency.

The following verification conditions are supported:

-   Domain checks (function application, axiomatic definitions, etc.)
-   Feasibility checks (operation preconditions)
-   Refinement checks (refinement correctness, **experimental**)
