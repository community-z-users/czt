\chapter{\Abs\ to \Betw\ finalisation proof}\label{ch12}

\section{Proof obligations}

The requirement is to prove that the between final state correctly
refines the abstract final state, and the between outputs correctly
refine the abstract outputs.  That is,
\begin{gzed}
%%\forall
  BetwFinOut
%%@
  \shows \exists a!:AOUT @ RabOut \land AbFinOut
\\
%%\forall
  BetwFinState
%%@
  \shows \exists AbWorld @ Rab \land AbFinState
\end{gzed}

\section{Output proofs}\label{ch12.out}

\begin{LThm}[\Betw\ world outputs refines \Abs\ world outputs.]%
\begin{theorem}{tBetwAbsFinalOutput}
\forall BetwFinOut @ \exists a!:AOUT @ RabOut \land AbFinOut
\end{theorem}~\end{LThm}

\section{State proof}\label{ch12.state}

From inference rule $B.5$, we can \textit{[cut]} $tBetwAbsFinalState$
to introduce an $AbWorld$ witness, where
%
\begin{gzed}
    R  ~~\defs~~  BetwFinState \\
    P  ~~\defs~~  (\exists AbWorld @ Rab \land AbFinState) \\
    D  ~~\defs~~  AbWorld \\
    Q  ~~\defs~~  abAuthPurse = gAuthPurse
\end{gzed}

In \zeves, this means instantiating $AbWorld.abAuthPurse$ with $gAuthPurse$.
Nevertheless, as \zeves\ uses sequence calculus, we would not be able to apply
case analysis this time because we would have two conjoined negations on the
assumptions rather than two conjoined predicates on the conclusions.
Therefore, we add the cases separately as in the PRG, but with a different
``\textit{[cut]}''!

\subsection{Case $AbFinState$}

This lemma is similar to that of mondex, with substitution directly.
%
\begin{LLemma}[Case: $cut$ on $AbWorld$ for the $AbFinState$ (12.3.1)]
\begin{theorem}{lBetwAbsFinalStateAbWorldCutAbFinStateCase}
    \forall BetwFinState @ AbFinState[gAuthPurse/abAuthPurse]
\end{theorem}~\end{LLemma}

\subsection{Case $Rab$}

Again the explanation of the proof of the next case was quite helpful and made
the automation straightforward. We just needed to add additional (obvious) lemmas
about the finiteness of the $chosenLost$ witness as $maybeLost$, and some time
information about $ConPurse~balance$.
%
\begin{LRRT}[Expanded abstract purse $balance$ type]
\begin{theorem}{rule rConPurseBalanceTypeOpen}
    \forall  purse: NAMES \ffun ConPurse; name: NAMES | name \in \dom~purse @ \\
        \t1 (purse~name).balance \in \nat
\end{theorem}~\end{LRRT}

\begin{LNewLemma}[$maybeLost$ is a finite set]
\begin{theorem}{lBetweenWorldMaybeLostIsFinite}
    \forall BetweenWorld @ maybeLost \in \finset~PayDetails
\end{theorem}~\end{LNewLemma}
%
\begin{LLemma}[Case: $cut$ on $AbWorld$ for the $Rab$ (12.3.2)]
\begin{theorem}{lBetwAbsFinalStateAbWorldCutRabCase}
    \forall BetwFinState @ Rab[gAuthPurse/abAuthPurse]
\end{theorem}~\end{LLemma}

\subsection{Actual state related theorem}

\begin{LThm}[\Betw\ world final. refines \Abs\ world final.]%
\begin{theorem}{tBetwAbsFinalState}
    \forall BetwFinState @ \exists AbWorld @ Rab \land AbFinState
\end{theorem}~\end{LThm}
