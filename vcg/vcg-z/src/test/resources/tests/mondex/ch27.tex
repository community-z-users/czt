\chapter{Initialisation, Finalisation, and Applicability}\label{ch27}

\section{Initialisation proof}\label{ch27.bc-init}

\begin{LThm}[\Betw\ to \Conc\ initialisation]
\begin{theorem}{tBetwConcInit}
   \forall ConInitState @ \exists BetweenWorld~' @ BetweenInitState \land Rbc~'
\end{theorem}~\end{LThm}

\section{Finalisation proof}\label{ch27.bc-fin}

Upon finalisation, it is possible identify the \Conc\
$definitelyLostCh7$ and $maybeLostCh7$ with the correspondent \Betw\
components.
%
\begin{LNewLemma}[Concrete $AuxWorld$ equivalence at finalisation]
\begin{theorem}{lCAuxWorldFinalEquiv}
    \forall AuxWorldCh7; BetweenWorld |  \\
        \t1 conAuthPurseCh7 = conAuthPurse \land archiveCh7 = archive @ \\
            \t2 definitelyLostCh7 = definitelyLost \land maybeLostCh7 = maybeLost %
\end{theorem}~\end{LNewLemma}
%
This is used in the next proof, as mentioned by the original Mondex
explanation below.

\begin{LThm}[\Betw\ to \Conc\ finalisation]
\begin{theorem}{tBetwConcFinal}
   \forall Rbc; ConFinState @ BetwFinState
\end{theorem}~\end{LThm}

We have defined $ConFinState$ and $BetwFinState$ to have the same
mathematical form.

$Rbc$ in the hypothesis requires the concrete and between purse
states and archives to be identical, and allows the between $ether$
to be bigger than the concrete $ether$.

Finalisation of the purses depends only on the purse states
(identical by hypothesis) and on the sets $definitelyLost$ and
$maybeLost$. These sets themselves depend only on purse states and
on the archive (also identical for concrete and between worlds by
the retrieve in the hypothesis).  As result, $gAuthPurse$ for
between finalisation is identical to that for concrete finalisation.

\section{Applicability proofs}\label{ch27.bc-applic}

Applicability follows automatically from the totality of the
concrete operations as shown in section~\ref{ch8.specproof-conc}.
