\chapter[\Betw\ to \Conc\  rules]{Refinement Proof Rules}\label{ch25}

Like in Chapters~\ref{ch9}, this chapter introduces meta-theorems
for the refinement rules, but for \Betw\ and \Conc\ instead of \Abs\
and \Betw.

The only formal part here for \zeves\ is the simplification of the
precondition in the general simulation rules.

%---------------------
\section{Security of the implementation}
%---------------------

We prove the concrete model \Conc\ is secure with respect to the
between model \Betw\ by showing that every concrete operation
correctly refines a between operation.  The concrete and between
operations are similarly-named.  The full list of refinements is:
\begin{gzed}
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  StartTo
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CStartTo
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  StartFrom
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CStartFrom
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  Req
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CReq
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  Val
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CVal
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  Ack
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CAck
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  ReadExceptionLog
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CReadExceptionLog
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  ClearExceptionLog
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CClearExceptionLog
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  AuthoriseExLogClear
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CAuthoriseExLogClear
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  Archive
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CArchive
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  Abort
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CAbort
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  Increase
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CIncrease
  \\ %
%%\forall \BOp; Rbc; Rbc' @
  Ignore
%%\implies
  \sqsubseteq CIgnore
\end{gzed}

Commented in the original PRG, these theorems are given as
%
\begin{gzed}
  \forall StartTo; Rbc; Rbc' @ CStartTo
\end{gzed}
%
which is a simplified version of the correctness theorem for forward
simulation with functional retrieve relation where $\pre StartTo =
true$.

%-----------------
\section{Forwards rules proof obligations}\label{ch15.proof-forward}
%-----------------

Each of these refinements must be proved correct.

%............
\subsection{Retrieve}
%............

The retrieve relation has one part that links the abstract and
concrete states.

%............
\subsection{Initialisation}
%............

\begin{gzed}
%%\forall
  CInit
%%@
  \shows \exists B' @ BInit \land Rbc'
\end{gzed}

%............
\subsection{Finalisation}
%............

\begin{gzed}
%%\forall
  Rbc; CFin
%%@
  \shows BFin
\end{gzed}

%............
\subsection{Applicability}
%............

\begin{gzed}
%%\forall
  Rbc ; BIn  | \pre BOp
%%@
  \shows \pre COp
\end{gzed}

%............
\subsection{Correctness}
\label{ch25.proof-forward-correctness}

%............
\begin{gzed}
%%\forall
  Rbc; COp | \pre BOp
%%@
  \shows \exists B' @ Rbc' \land BOp
\end{gzed}

We can simplify the correctness condition because we know that all
the between operations are total, i.e.
\begin{gzed}
\pre BOp = true
\end{gzed}
This was proved earlier, in section~\ref{ch8.specproof-betw-total}.
This is true because of the  disjunction with $Ignore$.

We can therefore simplify the correctness condition to
\begin{gzed}
%%\forall
  Rbc; COp
%%@
  \shows \exists B' @ Rbc' \land BOp
\end{gzed}
