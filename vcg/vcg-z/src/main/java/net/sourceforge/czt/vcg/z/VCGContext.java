/**
 * <p>
 * VCG contextual information to be used by various VC generation tools.
 * It includes meta-information about how state and operations are split 
 * or combined together. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For instance, on feasibility VCs we get a meta schema like
 * \begin{schema}{SpecProperties1}
 * 	  state: MyStateSchema
 * 	  init : MyStateInitSchema
 *    opN  : MyOpNSchema
 * \end{schema}
 * When asking the context for the operation type, for opN, it would return
 * a SchemaType for MyOpNSchema (i.e. its maximal type signature), whereas 
 * the bindings would return the declared names/types for the corresponding name.
 * This includes the state and init schemas. Similarly, we could have more
 * complex arrangements for refinement (i.e. ProdType and Pair of set of bindings).
 * \begin{schema}{REFSpecProperties}
 * 	  abs : SpecProperties1
 *    con : SpecProperties2
 *    opN : MyOpNSchema \cross MyConcreteOpNSchema
 * \end{schema}
 * where there is an implicit check that all operations involved at top-level
 * are declared in each abs/con meta-model. This way, we ensure that those operations
 * with refinement VC context will have FSB VC context set up properly as well.
 * </p>
