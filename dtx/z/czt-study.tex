a) DIFFERENCE BETWEEN \newcommand and \def
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% NOTE: See LaTeX Companion 2nd Ed, p. 846
%
% LaTeX \newcommand  = TeX \long\def = allow \par args
% LaTeX \newcommand* = TeX \def      = don't allow \par args
%
% * Yet, \def does not get messed up if redefining.
% * \renewcommand only works if already defined.
% * \def also allows "@" to appear in command names, which
%   cannot appear in the user's \newcommand definitions.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

B) COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN VARIOUS MATHEMATICAL OPERATORS DEFS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% or shall we adhere to LaTeX Companion's (p.505) suggestion
% that "{}\smash{#1}" is better? Keep the old way.
%
% zed.sty = \def\strut@op#1{\mathop{\mathstrut{#1}}\nolimits}
% oz.sty  = \def\z@op#1{\mathop{\mathstrut{#1}}\nolimits}
%
% For testing purposes of "\smash" version
%
%\newcommand*{\zpreops}[1]{\mathop{{}\smash{#1}}\nolimits}
%\newcommand*{\zrels}[1]{\mathrel{{}\smash{#1}}}
%\newcommand*{\zbins}[1]{\mathbin{{}\smash{#1}}}
%
% For testing purposes
%\newcommand*{\powers}{\zpreops{\mathbb P}}
%\newcommand*{\finsets}{\zpreops{\mathbb F}}
%\newcommand*{\lands}{{}\smash{\wedge}}
%\newcommand*{\landold}{\zrel{\wedge}}
%\newcommand*{\landolds}{\zrels{\wedge}}
%\newcommand{\lands}{{}\smash{\wedge}}
%\newcommand{\landold}{\zrel{\wedge}}
%\newcommand{\landolds}{\zrels{\wedge}}
%
%\[
%\begin{array}{ll}
%   x \land y = \lnot z \land w          &~\mbox{binary strut}~ \verb|\land|
%   \\
%   x \landold y = \lnot z \landold w    &~\mbox{relation strut}~ \verb|\land|
%   \\
%   x \lands y = \lnot z \lands w        &~\mbox{binary smash}~ \verb|\land|
%   \\
%   x \landolds y = \lnot z \landolds w  &~\mbox{relation smash}~ \verb|\land|
%\end{array}
%\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

C) OBSERVATION OVER HOW ONE COULD FIDDLE WITH MATH SPACING
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Fiddle with \verb|\thinmuskip|, \verb|\medmuskip|, or
% \verb|\thickmuskip| to adjust the relative spacing between
% the various formats (see Companion Table 8.7)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

D) VARIATION OVER DEFINITION OF TAB STOPS (\t1..\t9)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\newdimen\zedtab \zedtab=2em%
%
%% oz.sty definnition is simpler
%
%\def\ozt#1{\hskip #1\zedtab}
%
%% zed-csp.sty difinition seems uncessarily longer
%
%\let\tie=\t
%\def\t#1{\afterassignment\@t\count@=#1}
%\def\@t{\hskip\count@\zedtab}
%
% They both achieve the same result
