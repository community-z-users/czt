\section{Type Inference and Unification}
\label{inference}

In this section, we present two algorithms for type unification is
Object-Z. These algorithms are used in our typechecker to detect
inconsistencies between types, and to infer types of expressions and
declarations. Abstractly, the unification of class types is checking
that the sets of object identities in the two types are compatible,
meanwhile unifying the types contained in those identities. The first
unification algorithm is based around the notion of {\em weak
unification}, while the second is based around the notion of {\em
strong type unification}.

\subsection{Weak Type Unification}

The first unification algorithm is based around the notion of {\em
  weak unification}. To explain this, we use some  examples. Take the
  following declarations.

\begin{axdef}
  a : \poly A; b : B
\where
  a = b
\end{axdef}

In this example, if $B$ is neither a direct nor indirect a subclass of
$A$, then the predicate $a=b$ is ill-typed. However, if $B$ is
a subclass of $A$, such that the expression $\poly A$ is well-typed
, then the predicate $a=b$ is well-typed, even though
it is possible that $a \in A$, implying that the identities of $a$ and
$b$ comes from different classes. Checking the compatible of two
class types is therefore checking whether the two sets of object
identities in the types intersect.

One non-trivial aspect of the Z (and therefore Object-Z) type systems
is that all generic parameters must be instantiated with a type,
either explicitly by the specifier, or implicitly by the
typechecker. If there is not enough information for the typechecker to
infer a type for the parameters, the specification is
ill-typed. Object-Z presents problems with instantiation of generic
types that are not found in Z. First, take the following definition.

\begin{zed}
 G[X] == X
\end{zed}

This introduces, into the typing environment, the declaration $G : [X]
\power$ {\tt GENTYPE} $X$.
Now, we refer to $G$ in a predicate without explicitly instantiating
its parameters.

\begin{axdef}
  g_1 : G
\where
  g_1 = 1
\end{axdef}


Thus, at the point of referencing $G$, the typechecker cannot
determine a type with which to instantiate the generic parameter type
{\tt GENTYPE} $X$, so it will instantiate it with a {\em variable
type}, say $\alpha_1$. A variable type is not a type itself, but a
placeholder for a type. After evaluating the declaration $g : G$, $g$
will be introduced into the typing environment with the type
$\alpha_1$.  The typechecker then evaluates the predicate $g = 1$, it
will unify the type of $g$ with the type of $1$. Therefore, it will
unify $\alpha_1$ with {\tt GIVEN} $\arithmos$, which will give $g$ the
type {\tt GIVEN} $\arithmos$, and will in turn instantiate the
parameters of the reference to $G$ with {\tt GIVEN}
$\arithmos$\footnote{We assume the use of a pointer-like system in
which $\alpha_1$ in the type of $g$ is the same as $\alpha_1$ in the
type of $G$, so an update in one will be reflected in the other.}.

For class types, however, the inference is not so straightforward.
Consider another example using $G$ without explicitly instantiating
its parameters.

\begin{axdef}
  g_2 : G; a : A; b : B
\where
  g_2 \neq a \land g_2 \neq b
\end{axdef}

In this example, $A$ and $B$ are introduced by two unrelated class
paragraphs (by unrelated, we mean neither inherits the other).  The
typechecker attempts to find the minimal type that satisfies the
predicate $ g_2 \neq a \land g_2 \neq b$. That type is $ClassUnionType
\{A, B\}$. Therefore, when the typechecker evaluates $g_2 \neq a$, the
variable type $\alpha_1$ cannot be unified with the type of $A$,
otherwise the predicate $g_2 \neq b$ will fail due to the type of
$g_2$ being $A$ and the type of $b$ being $B$, which are
incompatible. Therefore, our unification algorithm needs to be more
clever than standard unification algorithms.

Figure~\ref{weak-unification-algorithm} presents our algorithm for
weak type unification. In this figure $\alpha$ represents variable
types, $s$ and $t$ represent types, $p$ and $q$ represent schema
signatures, $m$ and $n$ represent names, and $c$ and $d$ represent
$ClassRef$s. Number subscripts are appended to these names to indicate
different variables. That is, $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are distinct
variable types. We use the format $s = Type(s_1, \ldots, s_m)$ to
indicate that $s$ is of type $Type$, made up of types $s_1, \ldots,
s_m$. For example, $s = PowerType~s_1$ says that $s$ is a power type
of the type $s_1$. $s = ClassType \{c_1, \ldots, c_m\}$ indicates that
$s$ is a class type with class references $c_1, \ldots, c_m$. By class
references, we mean the state variable $classRef$ in the class
$ClassSignature$ in Figure~\ref{ClassType.fig}. $TypeVar$ and
$ClassTypeVar$ refer to variable types and {\em variable class types}
respectively. A variable class type is similar to a variable type,
except it is a placeholder for a class type only.

This algorithm is quite different to other type unification
algorithms, such as Spivey and Sufrin's algorithm for unifying Z
types \cite{spivey90}. Unification of the Z types resembles other
unification algorithms, in which unification of atoms is successful if
the atoms are equal, unification of terms is successful if the
function symbol, for example $PowerType$, is the same, and the
parameters can be unified, and unification of a variable with a term
succeeds provides that variable does not occur in the term. The
function $UnifySignature$, referenced on
line~\ref{alg:unify-signature}, is not shown, but this is a
straightforward comparison of two signatures to check that both
contain the same names with unifiable types. We assume the use of a
pointer-like system in the assignment of a type to a variable will be
reflected in other types that use that variable. Therefore, if
unification succeeds, parameters $s$ and $t$ are both the most general
unifier.

Class type unification is quite different. For starters, it is not
strictly unification, as we unify only parts of each of the types. For
example, calling $Unify$ with arguments $ClassUnionType \{A,
B[\alpha_1]\}$ and $ClassUnionType \{B[${\tt GIVEN} $\arithmos], C\}$
will succeed, with $\alpha_1$ assigned the value {\tt GIVEN}
$\arithmos$. However, the unification is only performed in the class
references with common names.

Stepping through the algorithm, we first examine the case of two
ground (containing no variable types) class types, which is handled in
between lines \ref{alg:state-ground-class-types} and
\ref{alg:end-ground-class-types} of
Figure~\ref{weak-unification-algorithm}. Recall that compatible class
types are those who object identities intersect. This part of the
algorithm checks this property. It does so by comparing the names of
the class references in each type. If there is no common names, the
types do not match, and unification fails (line
\ref{alg:end-ground-class-types}). Otherwise, the algorithm unifies
the types of the generic parameters of each class reference, which
will fail if any are incompatible. If any of generic parameters have
not been explicitly instantiated, that is, their types are variables,
then the unification algorithm will unify them not only in the class
reference set, but also in any other features from the class
signature, such as the state signature, because any reference to a
generic parameter will be replaced with the same variable type as any
other reference to that parameter. Therefore, the types of other class
features such as state variables need not be explicitly unified.

Now, we look at the handling of variable types --- lines
\ref{alg:start-variable-types} to
\ref{alg:end-variable-types}. Without line \ref{alg:empty-class-type},
this unification is much like others. If $\alpha$ occurs in type $t$,
which means that we have encountered a cyclic type, then the algorithm
fails. Otherwise, the type $t$ is assigned to the $\alpha$, unless
they are the same variable type ($\alpha = t$), then nothing
happens. Line \ref{alg:empty-class-type} is introduced to handle the case when
a class type is unified with a variable type. Recall the example
earlier in this section in
which a reference to the generic definition $G$ required implicitly
instantiation, and the resulting type is $ClassUnionType \{A, B\}$. In this case,
when the predicate $g_2 \neq a$ is encountered, the typechecker will
call $Unify(\alpha_1, ClassType\{A\})$. Assigning $ClassType\{A\}$ is
not possible, because when $g_2 \neq b$ is encountered, the
unification will fail (the class references to not
intersect). Instead, we assign to $\alpha$ the {\em class type
  variable} $ClassTypeVar~t$, in which $t$ is the {\em candidate
  type}. 

Now, we move to handling of variable class types --- lines
\ref{alg:start-var-class-types} to \ref{alg:end-var-class-types}. The
binary relation $\approx_{\tau}$ over two class types holds if and
only if the signatures of those two types are compatible. That is, the
types of commonly named features are unifiable. The binary function
$\cup_{\tau}$ represents the union of two class types. The first
branch in this block deals with the case that two class variable types
are unified.  If the signatures of the two candidate types are
compatible, then the candidate types, $s_1$ and $t_1$, are unioned, and
both class variable types are the same; otherwise the unification
fails. The second branch in this block deals with the case that a
variable class type is unified with a ground class type. If the
signatures of the candidate type in the variable class type and the
ground class type are compatible, then the candidate type is unioned
with the class type; otherwise the unification fails.

From this, one can see that the minimal type that satisfies a
specification such as our example above is found by unioning all
classes to which a reference can belong. Until one candidate type is
found, the type is a variable type. When a candidate type is found,
any subsequent candidates must be compatible with the existing
candidate type. The compatibility of two ground class types is checked
using the names and parameter instantiations of their class
references, which represents a check that their object identities
intersect.

Once a paragraph has been typechecked, the typechecker returns to
evaluate expressions whose type was initially a variable type to
ensure that the type is fully determined, raising an error if it is
not. Similarly, it returns to expressions whose type is a variable
class type, and uses the candidate type as the actual type.

\subsection{Strong Type Consistency}

The second unification algorithm is based around the notion of {\em
  strong unification}. To explain this, we again turn to an
  example. Z type rules specify that for a declaration, $v : E$, $E$
  must be a set; therefore, the type of $E$ must be power type. To
  typecheck this, the CZT typechecker will get the type of $E$, and
  check that it unifies with the type $\power \alpha_1$, in which
  $\alpha_1$ is a fresh variable type. If the unification fails, $E$
  is not a set, and the typechecker raises an error. If the
  unification succeeds, the type assigned to $\alpha_1$ (which may
  still be $\alpha_1$ or another variable type) becomes the type of
  $v$ in the typing environment. Now, consider the paragraph.

\begin{axdef}
 a : A\\
 b : B
\where
 a = b
\end{axdef}

In this example, $A$ and $B$ are unrelated classes. If we use the weak
 unification algorithm, after evaluating the two declarations, the
 types of $a$ and $b$ will be variable class types. When the predicate
 $a=b$ is evaluated, the candidate types in these, $A$ and $B$
 respectively, will be unioned, and the final type of both $a$ and $b$
 will be $ClassUnionType \{A, B\}$. However, this is not the correct inference. In
 fact, the typechecker should raise an error for the predicate $a=b$,
 because these classes are incompatible. Therefore, declarations and
 several other types of Z/Object-Z structures must be handled
 differently. For these cases, we use strong unification.

 For strong unification, there are three changes. Firstly, when we
 attempt to unify and variable type with class type, the variable is
 assigned the value of the class type. Therefore, line
 \ref{alg:empty-class-type} is removed from the algorithm in
 Figure~\ref{weak-unification-algorithm}. Secondly, there are no
 variable class types (these essentially become just variable types),
 so lines \ref{alg:start-var-class-types} to
 \ref{alg:end-var-class-types} are removed. Thirdly, the unification
 of two ground class types is different. Rather than checking that the
 class references intersect, they must be equal; that is, the same
 class reference names with unifiable types.

 Strong unification can also be used to give a tighter check on
 specifications. For example, if we have $a \in \poly A$ and $b \in
 B$, in which $B$ inherits $A$, then the predicate $a=b$ can be a
 possible downcast. That is, it is possible that $a \in A$ and $b \in
 B$, so we are comparing two incompatible types. The CZT typechecker
 provides a switch which allows strong unification to be used at all
 times, not just on declarations and other expressions that require
 strong unification, therefore reporting the $a=b$ is ill-typed. Many
 Object-Z specifications that we have used seen in literature and run
 through the CZT typechecker have passed typechecking with strong
 unification switched on.

\subsection{Termination, Correctness, and Completeness}

We have done proofs that our algorithms terminate, and are complete
and correct. Termination is straightforward to prove. Types are
represented using finite, directed tree structure, with the {\em
occurs} check in the unification algorithm preventing cycles. Any
recursive call to $Unify$ is called only upon the children of a node,
and from the definition of a tree, the depth of the child tree must be
less than the parent.
