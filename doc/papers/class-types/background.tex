\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{background}

In this section, we discuss some background and the motivation for the
work discussed in this paper.

\subsection{Object-Z}

The Object-Z specification language extends Z with modularity and reuse
constructs that resemble the object-oriented programming paradigm. Such
constructs include classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Late-binding
of types is typical in such languages, and allows for a high degree of
flexibility when specifying or implementing a system. However, the
Object-Z language provides no specific mechanism for explicit
type-casting of objects to aid the static analysis of type consistency
in such circumstances. Thus, an automated approach to type-checking
Object-Z must make inferences of object types taking into account the
inheritance hierarchy and object identity sets (which will be discussed
in further detail in the next section). 

Because casting of types is a dynamic property of the system (it is
essentially a test for set membership), and must be inferred
statically by the type-checker, a {\em completely} automated analysis
of type-consistency is an intractable problem; it requires proofs to
be discharged. As a consequence, the type-analysis algorithm discussed
in this paper can only provide a warning when an object is being
down-cast and the onus is upon the user to determine whether it is
possibly an illegal downcast (in Object-Z such a situation would
result in an operation being blocked). Detecting when such warnings
must be issued, and when it is not necessary, relies upon a thorough
understanding of how object identity is treated in Object-Z.

\subsection{Object Identity and Classes}

An object's identity distinguishes it from all other objects. The
value of an object is its identity, therefore two
different objects of the same type, $o_{1}$ and $o_{2}$, can have the
same values for their state, yet still be distinct objects; that is
$o_{1} \neq o_{2}$. The predicate $o_{1} = o_{2}$ is true if and only
if $o_{1}$ and $o_{2}$ reference the same object.

Object-Z's semantics implicitly include the concept of object identity
in the language, therefore giving it a {\em reference semantics}
similar to the treatment of object equality and assignment in
languages such as Smalltalk \cite{goldberg83} and
Java\footnote{\url{http://java.sun.com}}. This is opposed to a {\em
value-based semantics}, in which objects are denoted by the value of
the state.
% Tim, I had to make the distinction in that paragraph about assignment
% because Java actually has a pass-by-value semantics, and someone could
% pick on that.

The {\em dot notation} is commonly used in object-oriented languages
to dereference attributes or operations\footnote{From here on
the collective terms for attributes and operations is {\em features}.}
of an object. For example, the feature $x$ of an object $a$ is
accessed using the syntax $a.x$.

Using these semantics, an Object-Z class is a countably infinite set
of object identities, defined syntactically using a class
paragraph. The set $\oid$ represents the set of all object identities
in a system, such that for any class $A$, $A \subseteq \oid$ is true,
and for the set $\{ A_{1}, ..., A_{n} \}$ containing all classes in a
system, $\duni \{ A_{1}, ..., A_{n} \} = \oid$ is true.

In Object-Z, classes can be unioned to create polymorphic types. That
is, two classes $A$ and $B$ that share no common superclass, can be
unioned together to create a new set of object identities: $A
\classuni B$. The Object-Z type rules specify that any commonly named
attributes or operations in $A$ and $B$ must share the same types or
signatures respectively. These commonly named features are known as
the {\em polymorphic core} of the class union \cite{dong93}.

Object-Z also provides a {\em polymorphic operator}. That is, for a
class $A$, the expression $\poly A$ refers to the set of object
identities in $A$ and any subclasses of $A$, and is type consistence
if and only if each subclass of $A$ has at least the features in $A$
with the same types. The polymorphic core of this expression is the
features of $A$.

\subsection{Motivation}

Chen \cite{chen94} discusses a model in which an Object-Z class type
is a set of classes. That is, if we have a class $A$ with subclasses
$B$ and $C$, then the expression $\poly A$ is the set of classes $\{A,
B, C\}$. This idea is similar to the class types in our typechecker,
but we make two significant improvements.

Firstly, Chen does not discuss how to represent classes. In Object-Z,
classes are defined as countably infinite sets of object
identities. However, we need a way to represent these sets in the
typechecker, which requires some thought because programming languages
do not support infinite sets, and Object-Z provides us with no idea of
what the value object identities look like. Chen's examples use the
class names to represent the classes, but this does not provide
complete support for generic classes. For example, take the Object-Z
class defined in Figure~\ref{generic-class-A}.  In this example, we
have the generic class $A$, with generic parameter $X$ and no
features.  Two objects are declared using $A$: one with $X$
instantiated to $\nat$ and the other to $\power \nat$. The equality
$a_{1} = a_{2}$ is type incorrect because $A[\nat]$ and $A[\power
\nat]$ are disjoint sets of object identities. If only the class name
is used, we cannot not detect this, because the types of both
instances is $\{A\}$.

\end{figure}

The second difference is that we model the polymorphic core as part of
the class type. This is used to support Object-Z's renaming of
features in a class, for example, renaming an operation. The class $A$
with operation $op$ is not disjoint from the class $A[newOp/op]$,
which is the class $A$ with the operation $op$ renamed to $newOp$. The
Object-Z reference manual \cite{smith00} defines the set of object
identities of a renamed class to be equal to that of its base
class. Using only the object identities is not flexible enough to
detect whether a reference to a feature is valid.

In addition, if we reference a feature of an instance (for example,
$a.x$), then we have to lookup the type of $x$ in $a$ each time we
encounter such a reference, because the class type itself does not
maintain features and their signatures or types.  Similarly, if we
have a reference to a type $\{ A, B, C\}$ constructed via a class
union, then for a reference $a.x$, we need to calculate the
polymorphic core of $\{A,B,C\}$ each time it is referenced. We believe
a class type that records features, including those inherited from any
superclasses, simplifies and optimises the implementation of the
typechecker.

The purpose of the work in this paper is to provide a way of modelling
classes to provide a suitable class type that supports class union,
polymorphic expressions, and appropriately manages dereferencing on
objects, and to specify a unification algorithm for these types to
support type inference.
