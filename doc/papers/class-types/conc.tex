\section{Conclusions and Discussion}

In this paper, we discuss the model for class types for the CZT
Object-Z typechecker. We also present two type unification algorithms
for type inference and detecting type inconsistencies between
expressions. The first enforces a {\em weak} form of consistency
between two class types, and the second enforces a {\em strong} form.

The model of class types is flexible enough to represent the types of
class reference expressions, polymorphic expressions, and class union
expressions, all found in Object-Z, and also to handle typechecking of
generic class instantiations.

In the alpha version of the typechecker, we have found that the model
of class types presented in this paper is sufficient for detecting
type inconsistencies between Object-Z expressions and it makes type
inference and applying the type rules straightforward. It also fits in
well with the existing Z type system.

\subsection{Future Work}

We intend to explore the possibility of specifying the Object-Z type rules
using an extension of the type-inference rule metalanguage defined in 
\theStandard \cite{isoz}. In addition to this, the continued investigation
into inference techniques for Object-Z types is warranted -- particularly
deriving class types from operation and attribute promotions. 
This will be coordinated with the continued effort developing the
open-source CZT project.
