Object-Z is an object-oriented extension of the well-known Z
specification language. Like other formal languages, typechecking for
Object-Z can be automated using tools, however, little research has
gone into typecheckers for Object-Z to date. In this paper, we present
the model of a {\em class type} for Object-Z, which should work for
other formal object-oriented specification languages, and discuss two
unification algorithms used for type inference and detecting type
inconsistencies used in the Community Z Tools (CZT) Object-Z
typechecker, which is an open-source typechecker for Object-Z that is
built on the CZT Z typechecker.
