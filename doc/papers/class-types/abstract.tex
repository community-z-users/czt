Object-Z is an object-oriented extension of the well-known Z
specification language. Like other formal languages, typechecking for
Object-Z can be automated using tools, however, little research has
gone into typecheckers for Object-Z to date. In this paper, we present
the model of a {\em class type} for Object-Z, which is flexible enough
to work for other formal object-oriented specification languages with
type systems similar to Object-Z, and discuss two unification
algorithms used for type inference and detecting type inconsistencies
used in the Community Z Tools (CZT) Object-Z typechecker, an
open-source typechecker for Object-Z that is built on the CZT Z
typechecker.
