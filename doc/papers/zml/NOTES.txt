I've stopped using CADiZ as an example here, but think the issue
is still interesting.  I hope I've explained it better now ---
it's basically how tightly we want to validate the document
(a) EVERY paragraph, or
(b) just the paragraphs we know about.


Votes on the DTD/XML schema approach to defining math symbols:
Ian:  neither   (raw unicode is the most likely to be used)
Nick: DTD or neither (because the XML approach is not transparent to parsers)
Sun:  XML (or neither, because tools will use raw unicode)
Dong: Too busy waiting for the baby to arrive :-)
Andrew: XML (avoids going back to DTDs, makes everything ASCII and readable)
Mark: neither  (or XML if we MUST have ASCII compatibility --- but it is
                a pain that all the Z XML parsers will have to know about
		all these definitions to unfold them, and writers will
		have to put the definitions IN if we are serious about
		ASCII compatibility).

So I've deleted Section 5, and just added a fourth 'issue' discussing
whether it is useful to try and obtain ASCII compatibility.


Minor changes:
  I dropped the 'XML is ASCII of the new century' quote on page 1,
  because it seems more relevant to Unicode than XML and the previous
  point (quickly become a new standard for interchange between tools)
  is the point we want.

  Point 2 in Sect 2 (Previous work) has been dropped.  (it described
  a minor strangeness with Ian's DTD, which was just a bug).
