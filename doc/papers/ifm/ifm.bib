		  reviews the internationalisation of Z, discusses what
		  characters can be used in forming names, and summarises the
		  changes made to LATEX mark-up in ISO Standard Z. For Z tool
		  builders: it explains the sequence of processing that is
		  prerequisite to the lexing of a Standard Z specification,
