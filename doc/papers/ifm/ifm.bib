          considers the Z notation at the level of the individual
          characters that make up a specification. For Z authors: it
          reviews the internationalisation of Z, discusses what
          characters can be used in forming names, and summarises the
          changes made to LATEX mark-up in ISO Standard Z. For Z tool
          builders: it explains the sequence of processing that is
          prerequisite to the lexing of a Standard Z specification,
          and considers in detail the processing of LATEX mark-up.},
