\begin{abstract}
  This paper describes an extension of Z that allows transformation
  and reasoning rules to be written in a Z-like notation.  This gives
  a high-level, declarative way of specifying transformations of Z
  terms, which makes it easier to build new Z manipulation tools.  We
  describe the syntax and semantics of these rules, plus some example
  reasoning engines that use sets of rules to manipulate Z terms.  We
  demonstrate the utility of rules by discussing two sets of rules.
  One set defines unfolding of the schema expressions in Z.  The other
  set is used by the ZLive animator to preprocess Z expressions into
  a form more suitable for animation.

\section{Introduction}

In many Z tools, schema unfolding and other Z transformations are performed
by large amounts of low-level code (for example, in C or Java) that
manipulate the syntax of Z schema expressions and return equivalent
unfolded terms.  This low-level approach is error-prone, and the code that
performs the transformations is time-consuming to write and difficult to
read.  The problem is that the core ideas of the abstract transformations are
hidden in the masses of low-level code needed to manipulate syntax trees.

This means that building new Z transformation tools is time-consuming,
requires programming skills, and also requires detailed knowledge of the
API for manipulating Z syntax trees.  In contrast, in an ideal world, it
should be quick and easy to define new Z transformations by writing them in
the Z notation itself, in a high-level, declarative style that is easily
understood and can perhaps even be proven correct according to some given Z
logic.  A high-level notation such as this gives better support for the
capture and reuse of the knowledge implicit in the
rules~\cite{armour:business-model00}.

This paper proposes such a declarative notation, called ZedRules.  It
allows inference rules and rewrite rules to be written in a Z-like
notation.  Within rules, the standard Z notation~\cite{ISOZ} is extended to
allow \emph{jokers} that can stand for arbitrary expressions, predicates,
declarations etc.

Section \ref{sec:relwork} discusses approaches to schema unfolding and
user-defined transformations in existing Z tools.
Section~\ref{sec:syntax} describes the syntax and semantics of the
ZedRules.  Section~\ref{sec:tools} describes three example reasoning
engines provided by CZT~\cite{malik:czt05}, which use the rules.
Section~\ref{sec:schemas} shows how the rules can be used to specify
unfolding and normalisation of schema expressions,
and Section 6 shows some of the rules
that are used by the ZLive animator (which is part of CZT)
to preprocess Z expressions and predicates.


\section{Related Work} \label{sec:relwork}

We briefly consider how other Z tools provide support for unfolding
schema expressions and for allowing users to define domain-specific
transformations of Z expressions.

CADiZ~\cite{cadiz:refman02} provides several builtin commands (programmed
in C) for performing local schema transformation, normalisation, and
unfolding steps.  A \emph{schema expansion} tactic is provided, which
combines these steps to give a comprehensive schema unfolding and
normalisation facility.  Expert users are able to define their own
transformations by writing tactics in a high-level, functional, tactic
language.  It is easy to write Z terms and patterns within tactics, which
makes the notation more familiar to Z users.  The tactics support pattern
matching (using jokers), while our ZedRules generalise this to allow
unification.

Z/EVES~\cite{zeves:98} provides a fixed set of transformation
commands, including an unfold command for normalising schema
expressions and a rewrite command that uses certain kinds of theorems
as rewrite rules.  Since users can specify these theorems in their Z
specifications, this gives a way of adding domain-specific rewrite
rules.  However, the expressivity of rewrite rules is quite restricted
compared to the ZedRules notation of this paper.

ProofPower\footnote{See the ProofPower web site,
  \url{http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/index/index.html}.} provides
similar transformation commands as Z/EVES, but with a much larger set of
rewriting tactics, with a variety of behaviour.  It is also possible to
prove derived inference rules, which can have similar expressiveness as the
ZedRules of this paper (with premisses, jokers etc.).  However, such
rules are expressed in the proof notation of ProofPower (ML and HOL),
rather than in Z syntax.

Our ZedRules notation differs from the above approaches by allowing more
expressive rules to be written, and writing them in a declarative style in
a superset of Z.  As well as rewrite rules, it is possible to write general
inference rules with side-conditions.  We shall see that this is
sufficiently expressive that we can write a set of rules for unfolding
schema expressions --- one of the more complex aspects of Z.  In contrast,
the other Z tools use a mixture of builtin commands, rewrite rules and
specific tactics to implement schema expression unfolding.  Our hope is
that the additional expressivity of the ZedRules notation will make it
easier to specify many kinds of Z transformations, as well as being useful
for schema unfolding.


\section{Rule Syntax and Semantics} \label{sec:syntax}

This section describes the syntax and semantics of ZedRules.  We add
two new kinds of Z paragraphs to the Z standard notation, one for
rules and one for declaring jokers.  The ideas in this section are not
specific to CZT and could be adopted by other Z tools.

\subsection{Syntax}

Each rule is introduced with the keyword \emph{rule} and a unique name for
the rule.  It has a single conclusion, written below a line, and zero or
more premisses, written above the line.  The syntax of consequents and
premisses is that of Standard Z predicates extended with jokers.

For example, the \emph{Funct} rule from the $\V$
logic~\cite{brien:calculus-schemas-z00} might be written as follows:
\begin{zedrule}{Funct}
  \exists_1 x:F @ x.1 = E \\
  x \backslash E
\derives
  Y=F(E) \iff (E,Y) \in F
\end{zedrule}

The \LaTeX\ input for this rule is:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{zedrule}{Funct}
  \exists_1 x:F @ x.1 = E \\
  x \backslash E
\derives
  Y=F(E) \iff (E,Y) \in F
\end{zedrule}
\end{verbatim}

Most logics contain rules with meta-level side conditions, which check
various syntactic properties of the terms in the rule.  The most common
example is checking that a certain name~$x$ is not free in a given
term~$E$.  In the $\V$ logic, the not-free-in operator ($x \backslash E$)
is an object-level relation, but in many other logics, not-free-in is a
meta level operator, which we write as $x \notfreein E$.  To reason about Z
in a convenient way, it is also useful to be able to check properties of
signatures, distinguish between the different kinds of decorations on
names, etc.  The ZedRules notation provides a variety of provisos to
support this kind of reasoning.  Some of the premisses of a rule can be
provisos.  They are distinguished from normal premisses by a leading
$\proviso$ character (U+25B8), for example $\proviso x \notfreein E$.

It is also necessary to declare which names are metavariables
(jokers) and which syntactic roles they play.  For example, in
this $Funct$ rule, the $E,F$ and $Y$ names stand for arbitrary
expressions (we call them \emph{expression jokers}), whereas the $x$
is a concrete bound variable name.  In the ZedRules notation, each
joker name must be declared before it is used in rules.  For example,
the following declarations declare $E,F$ and $Y$ to be expression
jokers, $D1$ to be a joker that ranges over declaration lists, and
$V$ to be a name joker.

\begin{zedjoker}{Expr} E,F,Y \end{zedjoker}
\begin{zedjoker}{DeclList} D1 \end{zedjoker}
\begin{zedjoker}{Name} V \end{zedjoker}

We can group joker declarations and rules together by writing them
within one Z section.  The Z standard \textbf{parents} commands can
then be used to inherit one set of rules into another.  Note that,
since joker declarations and rule paragraphs start with \LaTeX\
commands that are not part of the Z standard, they will be treated as
narrative text by other Z tools, and ignored.  This allows us to embed
rules within Z specifications, but retain backwards compatibility with
Z tools that do not use the ZedRules notation.

\subsection{Type system}

The scope of a joker (currently) encompasses all rule paragraphs of
the section in which it appears and of which it is an ancestor.  In
the future, we plan to declare jokers locally to a rule paragraph
instead.  Global jokers are very concise (need to be declared just
once) but are less flexible because once a joker is declared, its name
becomes unusable as an ordinary Z name throughout its global scope.

The typechecking of a rule has separate static and dynamic phases.
The static phase uses the environment where the rule is written,
whereas the dynamic phase uses the environment where the rule is
applied.  The static phase determines which references refer to jokers
or to Z names declared locally within the rule.  The static phase
remains quiet about names that are not declared in its environment, as
they might yet be found to be declared during the dynamic phase.  The
dynamic phase ensures that the remaining references refer to
particular Z declarations in the environment where the rule is
applied.

Note that Z declarations that are in scope where a rule is written
might not be in scope where the rule is applied; there can even be
different declarations of the same names in the different
environments.

A rule is typically applied to a goal in a proof.  The environment of
such an application depends on the environment of the conjecture from
which the goal was deduced.  The environment of an application of a
rule to a term within a goal may also depend on the local variables of
the goal that are in scope for that term.

\subsection{Proviso Semantics}

Each proviso evaluates to either $PASS$ or $NOT\_PASS$.  The
evaluation of a proviso begins with taking into account known
instantiations of any jokers used in the proviso.  It typically uses
unification to determine instantiations of remaining jokers,
evaluating to $PASS$ only if those unifications succeed and the
particular test implemented by the proviso succeeds.  The following
provisos have been implemented.

\begin{description}
\item[Type:] $\proviso Expr :: Expr$.
  A type proviso passes if the right-hand expression is the carrier
  set of the type of the left-hand expression.

\item[Calculate:] $\proviso Expr \is Expr$.
  A calculate proviso passes if the calculation expressed by the
  left-hand expression produces a result that unifies with the
  right-hand expression.  These calculations are expressed using a
  restricted set of operators, which typically manipulate names and
  declaration lists.  Examples of these operators are given in
  section~\ref{sec:schemas}.

\item[Check:] $\proviso Name \notfreein Term$.
  A check proviso passes if the given $Name$ does not appear free in
  $Term$.  This is useful for logics in which not-free-in conditions
  are handled at the meta-level.  
  
\item[Lookup:] $\proviso Name \hasDefn Expr$.  A lookup proviso passes if
  there is a definition of $Name$ in the current context and if that
  definition's right-hand side unifies with the expression $Expr$.  The
  $Name$ can be followed by an instantiation list of expressions, allowing
  for lookup of generic definitions.  This provides a way of looking up
  definitions so that they can be used to unfold expressions.  We hope to
  generalise this further to 
  allow lookup of variable declarations and their constraining predicates.

\end{description}

The value of a proviso must be monotonic with respect to the
instantiation of jokers.  For example, given the proviso $\proviso x
\notfreein E$, it is not acceptable for the proviso to return $PASS$
when $E$ is a joker, but then return $NOT\_PASS$ after $E$ is
instantiated.  In fact, this property implies that when a proviso $x
\notfreein E$ contains a joker in $E$, either the proviso must return
$NOT\_PASS$, or the proviso must add constraints to the joker to
ensure that it can never be instantiated to contain a free $x$.  The
CZT implementation of ZedRules takes the former approach.  The latter
approach is more powerful, but also more complex to implement.


\subsection{Rule Semantics}

We describe the semantics of ZedRules independently of any operational
description of how rules can be used.  This allows rules to be used by
many different reasoning and rewrite engines.  Each engine may place
different restrictions on the rules that it allows, may apply rules
using a variety of operational semantics (apply once, apply
exhaustively, apply to all subterms bottom-up or top-down etc.), and
may use a different implementation technology (for example, an
interpreter that applies the rules or a compiler that transforms a set
of rules into code).

If the provisos of a well-typed rule all evaluate to $PASS$, then the
application of that rule is valid if and only if the conjunction of
its other premisses implies its consequent.  Note that the validity
of a rule depends on the context in which it is applied, and so
responsibility for ensuring that a rule is valid is shared by the
author and the user of a rule.  Proof tools are responsible for
ensuring that the derived rules produced by proofs preserve this
validity property.


\section{Tools for Rules} \label{sec:tools}

To use and test ZedRules, several tools have been implemented in the
CZT system.  These are useful for transforming Z in various ways, but
none of them are intended to be a general Z theorem prover, for three
reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There are already many other good theorem provers for Z, so
  developing another would simply fragment the existing small
  user-base further.
\item For practical theorem proving, it is necessary to develop a
  large set of rules (several for each Z construct), derived rules and
  tactics to automate the common styles of reasoning.  Experience
  shows that this requires several person years of theory development.
\item The speed of the current CZT implementation of ZedRules is not
  sufficiently fast for practical reasoning.  The automated proof
  engines can apply a few hundred rules per second, which is adequate
  for simple unfolding tasks, but not adequate for heavy-duty
  reasoning with lots of rules --- a good theorem prover needs to
  perform tens or hundreds of thousands of rules per second to be
  pleasant to use.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{An Interactive Prover}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cztprover1}
  \caption{Screenshot of Interactive Prover}
  \label{fig:cztprover}
\end{figure}

The interactive prover shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cztprover} displays a
proof in tree form.  Each node is labelled with a subgoal.  If a rule
has been applied to a node, it can have children (instantiations of
the premisses of the rule).  An icon indicates whether a node has
been proven (\ding{52}) or still needs to be proven ({\bf ?}).

The user can manipulate the proof tree by applying rules, evaluating
provisos, and undoing rule and proviso applications.  Clicking on a
node will pop up a menu offering the choices available for that
particular node.  For example, the menu for predicates to which a rule
has already been applied offers the option of undoing this
application.  The menu for predicates to which no rule has been
applied offers the choice of ``Auto prove'' or to apply one of the
matching rules.  It also has a ``Why not'' submenu, which lists all
the rules that cannot be applied.  By selecting one of those, the user
gets detailed debugging information about why the unification of the
selected predicate and the conclusion of a particular rule failed.

To provide the submenus ``Apply'' and ``Why not'', the prover goes
through all the known rules and tries to apply them to the current
predicate.  If this test application suceeds, the corresponding rule
name is added into the ``Apply'' submenu; if it fails, the name is
added into the ``Why not'' submenu.  While this approach might be too
inefficient and slow for large rule sets, it has been very helpful for
our purposes.

The ``Auto prove'' menu entry calls the automated prover described in
the next section.  If a proof is found, the resulting proof tree is
displayed as a subtree of the current node and the user can browse and
manipulate it.  Browsing a proof tree is eased by allowing subtrees to
be folded away by just clicking on them.  If the mouse pointer is
above a particular node, the tooltip gives information about whether
and which rule has been applied.

This interactive prover is a useful tool for the development of rule sets,
such as the rule sets that are used by the tools discussed in the following
sections.


\subsection{An Automated Depth-First Prover} \label{sec:prover}

This tool uses a depth-first search to find proofs automatically.
Given a predicate, it tries to apply the rules in the order they
appear in the Z specification.  If the conclusion of a rule can be
unified with the predicate, the resulting joker instantiations are
recorded and a sequence of new subgoals is created from the
premisses of the rule (taking the joker instantiations into account)
and attempted to be proven next (in the order provided by the rule).
If proving the new subgoals fails, the other rules are tried instead.
To discharge a proviso, code for checking the predicate is executed.
If this succeeds, the predicate is considered to be proven.

Note that this simple prover uses a shallow backtracking algorithm and
therefore might fail to find a proof even if there exists one.  If a
proof for a subgoal is found, the prover sticks to it and no attempt
is made to find an alternative proof.  The joker instantiations
associated with this particular proof might prevent another subgoal
from being proven and thus might prevent the prover from finding a
proof.  Even though this approach is less general than deep
backtracking, this has not been a problem for the rules used so far.
Furthermore, if a proof is found using shallow backtracking, it is
usually found more quickly than using deep backtracking.

\subsection{A Rewrite Engine} \label{sec:rewrite}

CZT also provides a rewrite engine that can rewrite a given Z term
using a given set of rewrite rules.  A rewrite rule is a rule whose
conclusion is of the form $t1~r~t2$, where the left side $t1$ must
match the term to be rewritten, the right side $t2$ represents the
result of the transformation, and $r$ is some equivalence relation.
Note that rewrite rules may have premisses, so applying such rewrite
rules requires proving any premiss predicates and provisos --- the
latter task is done using the prover described in
section~\ref{sec:prover}.

For example, the rewrite engine will rewrite a Z expression~$e1$ to
the Z expression~$e2$ if it can prove $e1 = e2$ using the given set of
rules.  Usually, $e2$ is not given but has to be computed.  To do
that, the rewrite engine asks the prover to prove $e1 = E$, where $E$
is an expression joker.  The rewrite rules should be designed so that,
if a proof is found, the right-hand side of the equation is ground,
i.e.\ does not contain any unbound jokers.  Then $e1$ is substituted
by, or rewritten to, $e2$.

The rewrite engine supports rewriting expressions (using $e1 = e2$
rules) and predicates (using $p1 \iff p2$ rules) just once.  It also
provides ways to combine rewrites into sequences of rewrites and
considers subterms in a top-down manner.  A given term is rewritten
until it does not change any more (the rule writer needs to ensure
termination of the rules), and then its subterms are rewritten in the
same way.

\section{Example Rules: Schema Unfolding and Normalisation} \label{sec:schemas}

\begin{zsection}
  \SECTION unfold \parents standard\_toolkit
\end{zsection}

This Z section contains rules for unfolding and normalising declarations
and schema expressions.  For example, given a schema expression such as $E
\land [x:\nat | p~x]$ where $E$ is the name of a schema, these rules define
an unfolding and normalisation process that will transform this schema
expression into an equivalent expression of the form $[D|P]$, where $D$ is
a list of variable declarations whose types are all carrier sets and $P$ is
a predicate that will contain constraints like $x \in \nat$ and $p~x$.

We start by declaring the jokers used in the rules.

\begin{zedjoker}{DeclList} D, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9 \end{zedjoker}
\begin{zedjoker}{Pred} P, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9 \end{zedjoker}
\begin{zedjoker}{Expr} E, E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9 \end{zedjoker}
\begin{zedjoker}{Name} V, V1, V2 \end{zedjoker}

To clearly distinguish our rules for unfolding declaration lists and
schema expressions from other rules, we introduce two new infix
operators: $\sexprUnfoldsTo$ and $\declListUnfoldsTo$.  
We do not really need to define their semantics in order to use them within
rules, but to reassure readers, we define their semantics to be just
equality.  In fact, the intention is that the right-hand argument
will be the unfolded and normalized form of the left-hand argument.

\begin{verbatim}
%%Zinword \sexprUnfoldsTo sexprUnfoldsTo
%%Zinword \declListUnfoldsTo declListUnfoldsTo
\end{verbatim}
%
\begin{zed}
  \relation ( \_ \sexprUnfoldsTo \_ ) \\
  \relation ( \_ \declListUnfoldsTo \_ )
\end{zed}
%
% NOTE: we are using an old version of oz.sty that requires {T}, not [T]
\begin{gendef}{SCHEMA}
  \_ \sexprUnfoldsTo \_ : SCHEMA \rel SCHEMA \\
  \_ \declListUnfoldsTo \_ : SCHEMA \rel SCHEMA
\where
  \forall s1,s2:SCHEMA @ s1 \sexprUnfoldsTo s2 \iff s1=s2 \\
  \forall s1,s2:SCHEMA @ s1 \declListUnfoldsTo s2 \iff s1=s2 \\
\end{gendef}


\subsection{Unfolding Declaration Lists}

We use the $\declListUnfoldsTo$ operator for unfolding declaration
lists.  The left-hand side is always of the form $[DeclList|true]$ and
the right-hand side (which is usually a generated output) is of the
form $[D|P]$, where the declaration list $D$ contains variable
declarations only, has no duplicated names and all its expressions are
Z carrier sets, and the predicate $P$ contains any additional typing
constraints that were in DeclList.

The next few rules specify the $\declListUnfoldsTo$ operator.
The rules are intended to recurse through a declaration list from left
to right, with the base case of an empty declaration list being handled
by the EmptyDeclList rule.  Note that multiple declarations such as
$x,y,z:T$ are expanded out into separate declarations before rules
are applied, so the rules that follow cover all possible kinds
of declarations.

The VarDecl1 rule is a special case of VarDecl2.  It applies when $E$ is
already a carrier set.  Since VarDecl1 comes before VarDecl2 in this file,
the rewrite engine (see Section~\ref{sec:rewrite}) gives it higher
priority, and this avoids introducing redundant tautologies (such as $E \in
\arithmos$, which is guaranteed to be true by the type system) into the
predicate.  This is an example of how we can influence the behaviour of the
rewrite engine by placing more specific rules before more general ones.  Of
course, in the interactive prover, the user could choose to apply either
rule when $E$ is a carrier set.

\begin{zedrule}{VarDecl1}
   \proviso E :: \power E \\
   [D1 | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2]
\derives
   [V:E; D1 | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [V:E; D2 |  P2]
\end{zedrule}

\begin{zedrule}{VarDecl2}
   \proviso E :: \power E2 \\
   [D1 | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2]
\derives
   [V:E; D1 | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [V:E2; D2 |  V \in E \land P2]
\end{zedrule}

\begin{zedrule}{ConstDecl}
   \proviso E :: E2 \\
   [D1 | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2]
\derives
   [V==E; D1 | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [V:E2; D2 |  V = E \land P2]
\end{zedrule}

The IncludeDecl rule creates a subgoal $E \sexprUnfoldsTo \ldots$ that
will invoke the schema expression rules in the next section.  So the
two sets of $\declListUnfoldsTo$ and $\sexprUnfoldsTo$ rules are
mutually recursive.

\begin{zedrule}{IncludeDecl}
   E \sexprUnfoldsTo [D1 | P1] \\
   [D | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2] \\
   \proviso ([D1 | true] \land [D2 | true]) :: \power [D3 | true] 
\derives
   [E; D | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [D3 |  P1 \land P2]
\end{zedrule}

\begin{zedrule}{EmptyDeclList}
   [~ | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [~ | true]
\end{zedrule}


\subsection{Unfolding Schema Expressions}

This section defines the unfolding of schema expressions,
using the $SE \sexprUnfoldsTo NORM$ operator, where $SE$
is a schema expression and $NORM$ is the resulting normalized
schema construction ($[Decls|Preds]$, where the types in $Decls$
are only carrier sets).

The TopLevel rule is an equality rewrite rule for expressions.  The
type proviso ensures that it is applicable only when $E$ is a schema
expression.  The last premiss uses the $\sexprUnfoldsTo$ rules in
this section to rewrite $E$ to $[D | P]$.

\begin{zedrule}{TopLevel}
  \proviso E :: \power [D2 | true] \\
  E  \sexprUnfoldsTo [D | P]
\derives
  E = [D | P]
\end{zedrule}

The Theta rule rewrites expressions into a binding.  The type proviso
is used to calculate the signature of $E$, then the theta proviso
generates the appropriate binding expression from that signature.  For
example, the binding $\lblot x==x,y==y \rblot$ is computed for
expressions $\theta~[x,y:\nat]$.
\begin{zedrule}{Theta}
  \proviso E :: \power [D | true] \\
  \proviso \theta [D | true] \is E2
\derives
  \theta E = E2
\end{zedrule}


The next rule handles decorated $\theta$ expressions.  However, this
version handles only a single prime decoration.  We need thirteen
versions of this next rule --- one for each possible decoration.  In
the future we will extend the ZedRules notation to support Stroke-List
jokers, so that all decoration lists can be handled by a single rule.

\begin{zedrule}{ThetaPrime}
  \proviso E :: \power [D | true] \\
  \proviso \theta [D | true] ' \is E2
\derives
  \theta E~' = E2
\end{zedrule}

Like VarDecl1 and VarDecl2, the SchemaConstruction1 rule is a special
case of SchemaConstruction2.  It applies to schemas that are already
normalised and avoids adding lots of redundant typing conditions into
the predicate part.
\begin{zedrule}{SchemaConstruction1}
  [D1 | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [D2 | true]
\derives
  [D1 | P] \sexprUnfoldsTo [D2 | P]
\end{zedrule}

\begin{zedrule}{SchemaConstruction2}
  [D1 | true] \declListUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2]
\derives
  [D1 | P] \sexprUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2 \land P]
\end{zedrule}

The SchemaRef rule uses the lookup proviso to unfold schema names
($E$ may specify an instantiation of a generic schema).  
The result of the lookup
is then normalised to obtain the overall result.
\begin{zedrule}{SchemaRef}
  \proviso E \hasDefn E2 \\
  E2 \sexprUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2]
\derives
  E \sexprUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2]
\end{zedrule}

This rule unfolds any remaining $\Delta$ schemas.  If the
specification explicitly defined the $\Delta$ schema, then the above
SchemaRef rule would have unfolded it.  There is a similar rule for
$\Xi$ schema names.

\begin{zedrule}{DeltaRef}
  \proviso \Delta \unprefix V \is V2 \\
  [V2; V2~'] \sexprUnfoldsTo [D1|P1]
\derives
  V \sexprUnfoldsTo [D1|P1]
\end{zedrule}


The SchemaPrime rule uses the schema prime proviso to decorate a
normalised schema.  Note that we also currently need thirteen versions
of this next rule --- one for each possible decoration.

\begin{zedrule}{SchemaPrime}
   E \sexprUnfoldsTo [D1 | P1] \\
   \proviso [D1|P1]~' \is [D2|P2] \\
\derives
   E~' \sexprUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2]
\end{zedrule}

The type proviso in the ExistsSchema rule checks that $D1$ and $D2$ are
type compatible.  The $\schemaminus$ proviso subtracts $D1$ from~$D2$.
The rule for schema $\forall$ is similar.

\begin{zedrule}{ExistsSchema}
   [D|P] \sexprUnfoldsTo [D1 | P1] \\
   E2 \sexprUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2] \\
   \proviso ([D1 | true] \land [D2 | true]) :: \power [D3 | true] \\
   \proviso ([D2|true] \schemaminus [D1|true]) \is [D4|true]
\derives
   (\exists D | P @ E2) \sexprUnfoldsTo [D4 | (\exists D1 @ P1 \land P2)]
\end{zedrule}

The semantics of schema negation requires schemas to be
normalised before their predicate is negated.

\begin{zedrule}{SchemaNegation}
  E \sexprUnfoldsTo [D | P]
\derives
  (\lnot E) \sexprUnfoldsTo [D | \lnot P]
\end{zedrule}

The SchemaConjunction rule is straightforward --- it uses a type
proviso to check that the signatures of the two schemas are
compatible.  The schema disjunction, implication and equivalence rules
are similar.

\begin{zedrule}{SchemaConjunction}
  E1 \sexprUnfoldsTo [D1 | P1] \\
  E2 \sexprUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2] \\
  \proviso ([D1 | true] \land [D2 | true]) :: \power [D3 | true]
\derives
  (E1 \land E2) \sexprUnfoldsTo [D3 | P1 \land P2]
\end{zedrule}

Schema projection, $E1 \project E2$, is also similar to schema conjunction,
but the resulting schema has only the names that are declared in $E2$.
Any other names that are declared in $E1$ are hidden existentially.

\begin{zedrule}{SchemaProjection}
  E1 \sexprUnfoldsTo [D1 | P1] \\
  E2 \sexprUnfoldsTo [D2 | P2] \\
  \proviso ([D1 | true] \land [D2 | true]) :: \power [D3 | true] \\
  \proviso ([D3 | true] \schemaminus [D2 | true]) \is [D4 | true]
\derives
  E1 \project E2 \sexprUnfoldsTo [D2 | (\exists D4 @ P1 \land P2)]
\end{zedrule}

To calculate the precondition of a schema, we must existentially hide
all the output names, such as $x!$ or $x'$.  The $split$ operator in
the following rule takes a declaration list and splits the names into
four groups according to their final decoration (for example, $[x, x',
y?, y!, z:T] \is [y:T]? \land [x:T; z:T] \land [x':T]\land [y:T]!$).

The declarations whose names have no decorations or a final decoration
of $?$ are collected in $D1$, while declarations whose names have a
final decoration of $!$ or $'$ are collected in $D2$.

\begin{zedrule}{SchemaPrecondition}
  E \sexprUnfoldsTo [D4 | P2] \\
  \proviso (split [D4|true]) \is ([D6|true]? \land [D7|true] \land
                                  [D8|true]' \land [D9|true]! ) \\
  \proviso ([D6|true]? \land [D7|true]) :: \power [D1|true] \\
  \proviso ([D8|true]' \land [D9|true]!) :: \power [D2|true]
\derives
  \pre E \sexprUnfoldsTo [ D1 | (\exists [D2|true] @ P2)]
\end{zedrule}

Schema composition is one of the most complex schema operators.
However, this SchemaComposition rule captures its semantics concisely.
First, the signatures of the two expressions $E1$ and~$E2$ are
computed, and all the names from $D2$ that have a primed version in
$D1$ are collected in $D5$.  Note that $\bowtie$ is a special
decoration that cannot be entered by users.

\begin{zedrule}{SchemaComposition}
  \proviso E1 :: \power [D1 | true] \\
  \proviso E2 :: \power [D2 | true] \\
  (split [D1|true]) \is ([D3|true]? \land [D4|true] \land [D5|true]' \land
                         [D6|true]! ) \\
  ([D5 | true] \schemaminus [D2 | true]) \is E6\\
  ([D5 | true] \schemaminus E6) \is E7 % matching names
\derives
  E1 \semi E2 =
  (\exists E7~{}^{\bowtie} @ (\exists E7~' @ [E1 | \theta E7~' = \theta E7~{}^{\bowtie}])
                   \land \\
\t5                   (\exists E7   @ [E2 | \theta E7   = \theta E7~{}^{\bowtie}]))
\end{zedrule}

%\subsection{Unfolding Quantified Declarations}
%
%When rewriting terms involving quantifiers, we want to
%rewrite and expand the schema text $E$ within quantifiers
%such as $\exists E @ P$ or $(\lambda E@E2)$, as well as rewriting
%the predicates and expressions within the body of the quantifiers.
%The rewrite tactics try to transform such schema text using the 
%$\schemaEquals$ relation.  So the following rule applies the above 
%schema unfolding rules to unfolding any schema text that appears within 
%the bound variable part of quantifiers.
%\begin{zedrule}{Quantifiers}
%   [D|P] \sexprUnfoldsTo [D1|P1]
%\derives
%   [D|P] \schemaEquals [D1|P1]
%\end{zedrule}


\subsection{Unfolding Schemas as Predicates}

If a schema expression $E$ is used as a predicate, it is equivalent to
checking that $\theta E$ (a binding constructed from names that are
currently in scope) satisfies the predicate part of $E$ (including any
subtypes in the declarations).  So this rule transforms any schema
expression that is used as predicate into $\theta E \in E$.
\begin{zedrule}{SchemaPred}
  E \iff \theta E \in E
\end{zedrule}

\section{Example Rules: ZLive Preprocessor} \label{sec:zlive}

In this section we show just a few of the rules that the ZLive
animator uses to unfold and simplify Z expressions before starting
animation.  When an expression is given to ZLive to animate, the first
phase of animation (after parsing and typechecking) is to use the CZT
Rewrite Engine (see Section~\ref{sec:rewrite}) to apply the following
set of rules to the expression.

\begin{zsection}
  \SECTION ZLivePreprocess \parents unfold
\end{zsection}

Note that this $ZLivePreprocess$ section has the $unfold$ section (see
Section~\ref{sec:schemas}) as a parent, so the schema unfolding rules
from the $unfold$ section are effectively the first rules in the
$ZLivePreprocess$ section.  If we wanted to reuse multiple rule sets,
we could simply list multiple parents, in the desired order.

The SchemaToSet rule unfolds schemas that are used as expressions into
set comprehensions.  Since this rule appears \emph{after} the schema
rule from the $unfold$ section, schema expressions will be unfolded
and normalised before this rule is applied.
\begin{zedrule}{SchemaToSet}
[D | P] = \{ D | P @ \theta [D | true] \}
\end{zedrule}

The next two rules are adapted from the sets toolkit and the relations
toolkit of the Z standard.  They illustrate how rewrite rules can be
used to unfold one operator and express it in terms of other simpler
operators.  ZLive needs no builtin knowledge of intersection or $\dom$
--- these two rules are all that is needed.  Around 40 of the standard
toolkit operators are unfolded by rules in this way.

\begin{zedrule}{intersection}
   E1 \cap E2 = \{x:E1 | x \in E2\}
\end{zedrule}
\begin{zedrule}{domain}
   \dom E = \{x:E @ x.1\}
\end{zedrule}

We finish this section with a rather bizarre use of rules.  ZLive uses
an internal data structure, RelSet, to represent function and relation
spaces, such as $\nat \fun \{0,1\}$.  This data structure records the
domain and range set, plus various flags according to the properties
of the function space (total, onto, functional, injective).  This
gives a compact representation of the function space and makes it easy
to efficiently check if a given set of pairs is a member of the
function space or not.  The following two rules illustrate how the the
Z function space operators are rewritten into strange $\LET$ terms,
which ZLive recognises and converts into a RelSet object.  These rules
are not true equalities, but are used to rewrite a term like $\nat
\fun \{0,1\}$ into the temporary $\LET$ form, which is then translated
into a RelSet object that is equivalent to $\nat \fun \{0,1\}$.

\begin{zedrule}{fun}
   E1 \fun E2 = (\LET isFun==1;isTotal==1 @ \power (E1 \cross E2))
\end{zedrule}
\begin{zedrule}{bij}
   E1 \bij E2 = (\LET isFun==1;isTotal==1;isOnto==1;isInj==1 \\
   \t3               @ \power (E1 \cross E2))
\end{zedrule}

Using rules to preprocess expressions and unfold schemas has made it
far faster to develop ZLive and makes it easier to experiment with
alternative translations of an operator.




\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:concl}

We have described the ZedRules notation and illustrated its utility
for schema normalisation and general rewriting.  The main advantage
of the notation is that it is a superset of standard Z and it makes it
much easier and clearer to develop Z tools that perform non-trivial
transformations.


In the future, we would like to be able to extend the ZedRules
notation to fully support a variety of Z logics, such as
$\Zc$~\cite{henson:revising-z-1-99,henson:revising-z-2-99},
$\V$~\cite{brien:calculus-schemas-z00} (a successor of the
$\mathcal{W}$ logic that appeared in early drafts of the Z standard).
It is desirable to support both $\Zc$ and $\V$ (and any future
proposals for Z logics), since they are rather different and it would
be interesting to compare them in a common framework.  For example,
substitution is a meta-level operation in $\Zc$ but is defined within
the object logic of $\V$.  To support richer logics such as these, it
would be necessary to generalise premisses into sequents that can
specify a different context to that of the conclusion.  For example,
a premiss such as $x:T \vdash P$ would allow the proof of $P$ to
proceed in an extended context where the new variable $x$ is declared
and has type $T$.  This is similar to the common sequent calculus
style of proof~\cite{girard:proofs-types90}.

The current CZT reasoning tools construct an explicit proof tree that
allows proofs to be recorded, replayed, displayed, checked by independent
tools etc.
It would be interesting to build a tactic layer on top of this proof
tree, using a tactic language such as ANGEL~\cite{martin:tactics}, which
has been used as the basis of several other Z provers
(CADiZ~\cite{Toyn98a}, Jigsaw1, Jigsaw2,
Ergo~\cite{martin:tac-lang-for-ergo}).
This would make it easier to program combinations of rules 
in flexible ways, whereas currently such tactics must be written as
Java methods.
If ZedRules was extended to support richer logics and the CZT tools were 
extended to support tactics, they could be used as practical Z theorem
provers (after a large amount of theory development).

In the future, we would also like to be able to translate rules
into a form that existing Z theorem provers can accept, so that we can prove
rules correct and prove that a given set of rules preserves the Z
semantics.  Our simple declarative semantics for rules makes this
easier to achieve.
