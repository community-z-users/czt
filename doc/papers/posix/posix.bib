@article{leuschel:prob08,

  title = {{ProB: An Automated Analysis Toolset for the B Method}},
  journal = {Journal Software Tools for Technology Transfer},
  publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
  pages = {Accepted for publication},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {We present ProB, a validation toolset for the B
                  method. ProB's automated animation facilities allow
                  users to gain confidence in their specifications.
                  ProB also contains a model checker and a refinement
                  checker, both of which can  be used to detect
                  various errors in B specifications. We describe the
                  underlying methodology of ProB, and present the
                  important aspects of the implementation.  We also
                  present empirical evaluations as well as several
                  case studies, highlighting that ProB enables users
                  to uncover errors that are not easily discovered by
                  existing tools.}
