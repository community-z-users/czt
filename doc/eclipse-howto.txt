Instructions on how to use Eclipse on a CZT project.

We used Eclipse 3.0 release candidate 1 from www.eclipse.org

Create a workspace at the top of the CZT hierarchy.

Create a new project.
    Use one of the CZT subdirectories, like zlive.
    Choose a Java project. (Eclipse will search for src and build
	directories) 
    Switch to the Java perspective (Eclipse should suggest this automatically)
    In project settings, add all the necessary .jar files
	from CZT home ./lib directory (all of them except zlive.jar).

In "Window/Preferences" in the "Java/Code Style/Code Formatter" tab,
import the CZT code style: eclipse-code-format-style.xml.

Eclipse will try to compile the project, and will get some errors:
    "The import JUnit cannot be resolved."
	    Right-click and choose "Quick Fix", then "Add JUnit libraries" 
    "Method assert(boolean) is undefined."
	    Go into "Window/Preferences" menu.  Then in the "Java/Compiler" 
	    tab, in the "Compliance and Classfiles" tab, change all the
	    compliance levels to Java 1.4.  Also, to ENABLE the assert
	    statements, ???

Select the root of the project tree (eg. zlive) and use "Project/Share
Project" to tell Eclipse that you are using CVS.

To allow your project ant build files to use JUnit, go into
"Window/Preferences/Ant/Runtime/ClassPath", and add
<ECLIPSEHOME>/plugins/org.junit_3.8.1/junit.jar to the "Ant Home Entries"
list.
