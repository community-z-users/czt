# Identifying Problems

After the current editing specification is parsed and typechecked, the editor will report the
problems to the user in several ways.

1.  Display the problem markers within/around the editor

    ![Problem Indicators in Editors](../images/editor_problem_indicator.png)

    By hovering on the problem indicators, you can see the description about the problem.
2.  Add problem entries to the **Problems** view

    ![Problem Entries in Problems view](../images/problems_view_entry.png)

    Each problem entry shows you the location, as well as the description, of the corresponding
    problem.
3.  Display error indicators in the Outline view

    The problem marker on an Outline entry means that the underlying term of the entry contains
    problems.
