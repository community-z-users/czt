# Create New CZT Projects

The CZT editor plug-in provides a convenient wizard to help create a new project for editing
Z specifications. The wizard can be opened using the menu entry
**File > New > Project... > CZT > CZT Project**.

-   In this wizard, enter the name of the new project.

-   If you do not want to use the default location, specify one.

If the CZT perspective is not opened at the moment, the wizard will ask you whether you want to
open the CZT perspective. It is highly recommended that you open it because it will automatically
open a set of Eclipse elements useful for the CZT development.  Then the new project will be
created and selected in the workbench window.
