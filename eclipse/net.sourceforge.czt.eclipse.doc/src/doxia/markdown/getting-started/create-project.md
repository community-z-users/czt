# Creating a CZT project

Create a new CZT project to contain Z specifications by selecting **File > New > Project > CZT > CZT Project** in the menu.

![New CZT project wizard](../images/wizard_project.png)

1.   Enter the name of the new project (how it will be displayed within Eclipse workspace).
2.   If you do not want to use the default location, specify one.

     _Note: you can create CZT project on you existing directories: just specify an existing directory in the Location field. The name does not have to match the directory._


If the **Z perspective** is not active at the moment, the wizard will ask you whether you want to
open the Z perspective. It is highly recommended that you open it because it will automatically
open a set of Eclipse views useful for the Z development.  Then the new project will be
created and selected in the workbench window.
