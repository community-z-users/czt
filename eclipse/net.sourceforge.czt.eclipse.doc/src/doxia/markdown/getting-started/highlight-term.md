# Highlight a Term

To highlight a Z term in the editor, you can follow the follow two steps:

1.  Position the cursor within a term. For example, the below figure shows that the cursor is
    positioned within the name "NAME".

    ![Select a Name](../images/select_name.png)

2.  Select the menu entry **Edit > Highlight > Enclosing Term**.

Then the smallest term containing the cursor position is highlighted in the editor as show below.

![Term Highlight](../images/term_highlight.png)

If you want to highlight a bigger term, just perform the highlight command continuously.
The biggest term that can be highlighted is a Z paragraph. If a Z paragraph is already
highlighted, then this command does nothing.

The **Edit > Highlight > Restore Last Highlight** does the reverse way of highlight. If the
currently highlighted term is term that was highlighted at first, then this command does nothing.

You can also start the highlight procedure from a bigger term, rather than a point, by selecting
a bigger segment of text before performing the highlight command.
