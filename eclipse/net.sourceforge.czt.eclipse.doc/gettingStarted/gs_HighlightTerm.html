<h1>Highlight a Term</h1>
<p>To highlight a Z term in the editor, you can follow the follow two steps:</P>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Position the cursor within a term. For example, the below figure shows that the cursor is positioned within the name "NAME".</p>
<p><img src="../images/select_name.png" alt="Select a Name" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the menu entry <b><font color="purple">Edit &gt; Highlight &gt; Enclosing Term</font></b>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then the smallest term containing the cursor position is highlighted in the editor as show below.</p>
<p><img src="../images/term_highlight.png" alt="Term Highlight" /></p>
<p>If you want to highlight a bigger term, just perform the highlight command continuely. The biggest term tha can be highlighted is a Z paragraph. If a Z paragraph is already highlighted, then this command does nothing.</p>
<p>The <b><font color="purple">Edit &gt; Highlight &gt; Restore Last Highlight</font></b> does the reverse way of highlight. If the currently highlighted term is term that was highlighted at first, then this command does nothing.</p>
<p>You can also start the highlight procedure from a bigger term, rather than a point, by selecting a bigger segment of text before performing the highlight command.</p>
