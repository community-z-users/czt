<h1>Folding</h1>
<p>The Z paragraphs can be folded in the CZT editor as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="../images/folding.png" alt="Folding" /></p>
<p>The "+" before a folded paragraph indicates that the paragraph can be expanded to show its contents in the editor, while the "-" indicates that the paragraph can be collapsed to show only the first line of the paragraph.</p>
<p>By default, all kinds of Z paragraphs are to be folded in the editor. Users can enable/disable the folding feature, choose a certain set of Z paragraph type to be folded, in the editor through the <a href="../reference/preferences/editor/ref_pref_folding.html">Folding</a> preference page.</p>
