z2svg is intended to allow browsing of the well-formed formulae of a Z
specification using a standard web browser with a SVG plug-in.  The
well-formed formulae of a Z specification include paragraphs, schema
texts, predicates and expressions.  This tool will provide the ability to
select well-formed formulae and then offer a set of operations that
are applicable to the selected formulae from which the user can
choose.  z2svg is inspired by the CADiZ browsing interface, but to
work on the web.

SVG allows objects to be grouped together, transformed and animated.
This makes it possible to highlight well-formed formulae without
redrawing the entire page.  It should also allow the layout of the Z to
be adapted to resizing of the window.
