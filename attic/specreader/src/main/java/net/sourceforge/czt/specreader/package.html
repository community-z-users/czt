Provides the first level of processing of LaTeX mark-up of a Z specification,
as directed by the ISO Z standard.
Involves gathering the sections into definition-before-use order,
and moving mark-up directives to the beginnings of their sections.
Informal narrative text is elided unless specifically requested.
</p>
<p>
Class {@link net.sourceforge.czt.specreader.SpecReader SpecReader}
extends {@link java.io.Reader Reader}
to allow the text of the resulting sections
to be read in order as a single stream.
It also defines a
{@link net.sourceforge.czt.specreader.Main#main(String[]) main}
that copies the text of that stream to <tt>System.out</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Gathering commences at a given <tt>fileName.tex</tt>.
Sections that are part of the standard Z toolkit
are read from a library resource.
Other parent sections are read from <tt>parentName.tex</tt>
in the current directory,
if they have not been defined in files already read.
Anonymous sections are given explicit section headers, as follows.
</p>
<pre>section filename parents standard_toolkit</pre>
<p>
Directives are added
to allow error reports from subsequent processing
to refer to the text in its original context:
</p>
<pre>%%Zfile filename.tex</pre>
<p>
precedes text that came from the named file;
</p>
<pre>%%Zloc 12#1@254</pre>
<p>
precedes text that started on line 12 at column 1
with the 254th character from the file.
</p>
<p>
Occurrences of the following Z mistakes are detected:
</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple sections with the same name;
<li>section not found;
<li>cycle in the parents relation;
<li>anonymous section in same file as named section.
</ul>
<p>
The Reader's constructor throws an exception on detecting any of these mistakes,
and hence no text can be read in their presence.
</p>
<p>
Regarding efficiency, either the entire text is buffered in memory,
or each block of text is recorded by its offset and length in its file.
The latter requires that the files be read again to retrieve the text,
and so is slower but uses less memory at any one time.
As Java does not support random access to Unicode character files,
re-reading a block of text that originally appeared before the block
that it now follows involves reading its file again from the beginning.
Such re-ordering happens if sections are used before they are defined,
and if mark-up directives are used before they are defined.
In the worst case, a file containing n sections is re-read 2n times,
though only on one of those occasions will it be read all the way to the end.
The re-reading alternative currently buffers an entire section on re-reading,
so uses more memory than might be expected.
