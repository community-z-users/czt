/**
 * Location annotations define the source-code location of a construct.
 * The Line and Col numbers, if present, refer to an identifying
 * token within the construct, such as the equality token of an
 * equality predicate, or the opening brace of a set comprehension.
 * The Line and Col numbers start from (0,0), so may need adjusting
 * to give correct positions in various editors.
 * The Start number, if present, gives the position of the start
 * of the construct from the beginning of the document (0 means
 * the first character of the document), and the Length number gives
 * the number of characters from the beginning of the construct to
 * the end.  The Length may be zero if the construct exists in
 * one markup, but is not visible in another markup.
 *
