Differently from process parameters, process indexes are not within
the scope of the process, hence cannot be referenced explicitly. 
%
\begin{circus}
    \circchannel in : \nat \\
    \circprocess\ P \circdef\  i: \nat \circindex (\circbegin \circspot\ in?x \then x := i  \circend)
\end{circus}
%
Indexed processes are used semantically to rename (and retype) 
all channels, so that one can refer to channel communications as 
events, like one can do in CSP. That is, if one want to refer to 
(i.e., synchronise on) a particular even, say $c.0$, the way to do it is
to use $P \lcircindex 0 \rcircindex$. This way, we will have $P$ with
channel $ih\$\$i \in \nat \cross \nat$, and all occurrences of $in$ are
renamed/retype accordingly. For instance, in a communication
$in?x$, it would become  $in\$\$i.0?x$.
