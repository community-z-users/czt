Unfortunately, it's not possible (???) to have mixfix ApplExpr with explicit generic
\begin{theorem}{catGen}[X]
 (\_ \cat \_)[X] (s,t) = s
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}{prefixGen}[X]
     \forall A: \power~X @ \forall S: \finset~A @ \#~S = (\# \_)[A]~S
\end{theorem}
Result must not have parentheses (and varargs) between "#" and genactuals and should be something like:
<cmd name="add-paragraph"><theorem-def location="L8;C0;S142;E267;G125;Rbb1.zed"   >lNonMaximalCardEquiv
[X]

<ax-part/>&forall;  A: &Popf; (X) &bullet; &forall;  S: &Fopf; A &bullet; (#) (S)  =  (#[A]) (S)

</theorem-def></cmd>


At the moment because explicit generics in CZT asks for VARARGS, we have:

<ax-part/>&forall;  A: &Popf; (X) &bullet; &forall;  S: &Fopf; A &bullet; (#) (S)  =  ((# _ )[A]) (S)

Bypassed it (after revision 7859) to the right result by looking the OpStack in two places (top-1, top) for ApplExpr->RefExpr

Now, if we try to do this proof, ZEves sends commands back like

$
A \in \power~X \land S \in \finset~A \implies \#[X]~S = \#[X]~A
$

which CZT fails to parser because of the explicit generics in the wrong place :-(

   use sizeDef[X];

\begin{theorem}{postfixGen}[X,Y]
   \forall f: X \pfun Y @ q = f\inv
\end{theorem}

\begin{zproof}[postfixGen]
   invoke (\_ \pfun \_);
\end{zproof}

\begin{theorem}{postfixGen2}[X,Y]
    q = (\_~\inv)[X,Y] f
\end{theorem}
Translation for \inv actually is accepted by Z/EVES with varargs and parentheses:
<cmd name="add-paragraph"><theorem-def location="L19;C0;S607;E680;G73;Rbb1.zed"   >postfixGen
[X, Y]

<ax-part/>q  =  (f) (( _ &suptilde;)[X, Y])

</theorem-def></cmd>


 A version without varargs that is supported by Z/EVES looks like the following:
<cmd name="add-paragraph"><theorem-def location="L19;C0;S607;E680;G73;Rbb1.zed"   >postfixGen
[X, Y]

<ax-part/>q  =  (f) &suptilde;[X, Y]

</theorem-def></cmd>


 At the moment because of explicit generics, we have:

<ax-part/>q  =  (f) ((_ &suptilde;)[X, Y]))

Trouble is that being this a postfix function (rather than infix), it is treated specially :-(
By passed it (after revision 7859) to have the middle parenthesis always with generics within as

<ax-part/>q  =  (f) ((&suptilde;[X, Y]))

Humm... ZEves doesn't like the extra parenthesis. :-( We need to remove then

\begin{zproof}[postfixGen]
use functionFinite[X, Y][A:=X, B:=Y];
use invDef[Y,X][R := f];
with enabled (sizeDef) prove;
\end{zproof}

Result must not have parentheses between "functionFinite" and genactuals and should be something like
<cmd name="proof-command">use functionFinite[X, Y]</cmd>

At the moment the RefExpr is being considered with Explicit generics (!) as if within ApplExpr or RefExpr (GenOpInst)

<proof-part/>
use (invDef[Y, X])[R := f];
with enabled (invDef) invoke;
use (functionFinite[X, Y])

FIXED: RefExpr for UseCommand should be treated differently

<proof-part/> use invDef[Y, X][R := f];
with enabled (invDef) invoke;
use functionFinite[X, Y]

The proof also returns

\begin{theorem}{domGen}[X, Y]
     \dom[X, Y]~A = \emptyset
\end{theorem}
 Result must not have parentheses between "dom" and genactuals and should be something like:
<cmd name="add-paragraph"><theorem-def location="L29;C0;S784;E854;G70;Rbb1.zed"   >domGen
[X, Y]

<ax-part/>(<word style="roman"/>dom<word/>[X, Y]) (A)  =  &empty;

</theorem-def></cmd>

 Note that the same issue exists with \bigcap, \bigcup, tail, etc.

This problem is fixed by the same solution to the postfix genactuals on \inv above. Now we have

<ax-part/>((<word style="roman"/>dom<word/>[X, Y])) (A)  =  &empty;

\begin{theorem}{cupGen}[X]
    (\_ \cup \_)[X] (A, B) = \emptyset
\end{theorem}
 The above is also accepted nicely by Z/EVES and gets translated into infix relation:
  A \cup[X] B = \emptyset
 Which is, of course, unparseable in proof by CZT

The fix above for \inv, breaks this one now because it is not sending the "_\cup_" but just "\cup.

<ax-part/>((&cup;[X])) ((A, B))  =  &empty;

FIX: add a check for when ApplExpr.getRightExpr() is TupleExpr, in which case the "_" should be kept,

<ax-part/>((_&cup;_[X])) ((A, B))  =  &empty;

FIX: zeves doesn't like this case and needs it to be

<ax-part/>(((_&cup;_)[X])) ((A, B))  =  &empty;

\begin{zproof}[cupGen]
   apply extensionality;
\end{zproof}
