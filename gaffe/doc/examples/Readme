This directory contains example interfaces.  Until interaction with the
animator is done, they need the use of custom History classes that fake the
work of the animator.

Fake.gaffe matches to the history class FakeHistory
BirthdayBook.gaffe matches to the history class BirthdayBookHistory

GeneratedBirthdayBook.gaffe matches to the history class BirthdayBookFullHistory
GeneratedBirthdayBook.gaffe was generated using the following command:
  gaffe-generate -spec ~/usr/czt/zml/examples/birthdaybook_unfolded.xml -stateSchema BirthdayBook -opSchema AddBirthday -opSchema FindBirthday -opSchema Remind -destination test.gaffe
after this, it was edited to set the history object to BirthdayBookFullHistory
