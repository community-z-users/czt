Generator Changelog:
28 Nov 2003 -
	- Removed the DOM based interface generator, and bean chooser plugins
	- Set up Generator to use BeanInterfaceGenerator and BeanChooser plugins instead.
	- Changed BeanChooser interface to just return a Component, rather than having the Form, and parent
	  Container passed in.  This no longer causes problems; because, as of 26 Nov, any children of this
	  Component will be added to the Form as well.
	- Changed BeanChooser interface to also take a boolean 'editable' to indicate whether the created 
	  beans are intended for user input or not.
	- Finished, but haven't tested the BasicBeanInterfaceGenerator.
	- Changed one of the checks for stateSchemaName==null in CommandLineSchemaIdentifier to throw an 
	  Error, because command line options should be processed before identifySchema is called.
	- To do:
		- Fix BeanChooser to handle a wider range of type expressions.	e.g. RefExpr.
		- Fix BeanChooser to handle input through tables.	

19 Nov 2003 -
	- Started work on InterfaceGenerator implementation.  May get discarded.
	- Started work on version of the BeanChooser and InterfaceGenerator classes that create the 
	  interfaces, and use XMLEncoder, rather than using DOM.
		- Methods for creating parts of the interface with DOM were becoming lengthy, repetitive, and
		  rather opaque.
	- Added URL parameter for the interface generator plugin, URL indicates location of Z specification.
	- To do:
		- Remove XML DOM based interface generator and bean chooser plugins, change Generator to 
		  account for this.

13 Nov 2003 - (uncommited)
	- Reintroduced BadArgumentsException as BadOptionException.
		- Used by PluginList, and various OptionHandlers to indicate a problem with information
		  received from the plugins.
		- Modified PluginList.processOptions to catch and report BadOptionException.
	- Introduced PluginInstantiationException.
		- Used by PluginList to indicate that for some reason a plugin implementation could not be
		  instantiated.
		- Caught and forwarded as a BadOptionException in many places in PluginList.
	- Added code to run anonymous options (optionName==null) with no argument when option processing has
	  finished.  This way plugins can check that they have been given all the data they need.
	- Fixed Name2String.
		- Wasn't applying itself to Strokes.

12 Nov 2003 -
	- Added javadoc documentation for all files.
	- Added license header to all files.
	- Made 'all' target dependent on 'doc'.
	- Removed the BadArgumentsException class (no longer being used).

 7 Nov 2003 (3) - 
	- Added a plugin for selecting the location to which the interface should be written.

 7 Nov 2003 (2) - 
	- Revamped the command line handling system used by plugins.
		- Introduced Option class for describing a command line option.
		- Introduced PluginList class for handling a collection of plugins, processing a command 
		  line, and for displaying help.

 7 Nov 2003 -
	- Modified classes to be compatible with the new naming scheme for the corejava libraries.
	- Modified the build file to find the new jar files in the corejava libraries.
		- Disabled the available/fail check, was failing because the JAXB libraries weren't in the 
		  classpath.
	- Added help display to Generator
	- Seperated command line argument processing into seperate, more general, utility function in
	  Generator.
	- Added a getArgsDocumentation method to all plugins for use when '-help' is supplied on the command
	  line.
	- Added getStateVariables method to VariableExtractor.
	- Created the DOMInterfaceGenerator plugin class.

29 Oct 2003 - First commit to CVS
	- Package name = net.sourceforge.czt.animation.gui.generation
	- Written as a series of plugins.
		- Plugin interfaces are defined in n.s.c.a.g.g.plugins
		- Plugin implementations are defined in n.s.c.a.g.g.plugins.impl
		- SpecSource - retrieves an AST of a Z specification.
		- SchemaExtractor - finds all of the schemas in the AST.
		- SchemaIdentifier - identifies which schemas are irrelevant, which are state, init, and 
		  operation schemas.
		- VariableExtractor - identifies the relevant variables for input and display in each schema.
		- DOMBeanChooser - decides on an appropriate display/input bean for a given variable, and
		  produces the XML code for the interface.
			- Incomplete.
		- Generator - puts together the bits of interface for each variable to create the whole 
		  interface file.
			- Not yet written.
	- Each plugin provides a method for getting what info it needs from the list of arguments (sourced 
	  from the command line).
	- The implementation used for a particular plugin can be specified on the command line.
	- To do:
		- Write DOMBeanChooser.
		- Instead of having BeanChooser plugin produce XML, have it produce actual beans, use Encoder
		  to write the file???
		- Write Generator(s).
		- Write better implementations of plugins.
