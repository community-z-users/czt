Generator Changelog:
18 Mar 2004 - (not committed)
        - Removed depend from classes target in build.xml.
                - Should make builds a bit faster.
        - Made Fixes to BasicBeanInterfaceGenerator.
                - Mostly scripts, and bean names.
                - So now it produces interfaces that will actually work (given a
                  working back-end).
        - Fixed build.xml to work with new version of czt.properties
                - which now uses rhino.jar, bsf.jar, and not rhino.home,
                  bsf.home.
                - Should still work with the old version too!

 8 Jan 2004 -
	- Copied checkstyle rule from corejava into build.xml

 7 Jan 2004 -
	- Modified build.xml to make use of czt.properties.
	- Modified build rules for scripts so that only the scripts rule for the platform will be called.
		- Didn't work before, because dependencies get run regardless of the success or failure of an
		  'if' property on a 'target' element.
	- Modified build rule for scripts so that path of JWSDP's JAXB libraries are added to the classpath 
	  in the script.
	- Changed FileInterfaceDestination plugin to guess an output name when input file ends with .xml,
	  not just .zml.
	- Changed name of a BufferedReader in SpecReaderSource (from reader to authReader) to distinguish it
	  from another Reader that did have the same name.

 5 Dec 2003 -
	- Moved where the config script(s) get run in Generator.
		- Placed it just before the interface is generated.  Doesn't need to be earlier, avoids extra
		  time being taken if the program stops before generating the interface (e.g. if -help was
		  used).
	- Corrected BasicBeanInterfaceGenerator to use thisForm.lookup instead of thisForm.locate in 
	  generated scripts.
	- Corrected BasicBeanInterfaceGenerator to use java.lang.System.exit, System was not imported.

 4 Dec 2003 (2) -
	- Changed History classes to accept properties specifying the names of the state and init schemas.
		- Changed generator to reflect this.
	- Made corrections to generated init script to prevent errors at runtime.
	- Fixed generated scripts to refer to History.previousSolutionSet and History.previousSolution, not
	  History.prevSolutionSet and History.prevSolution.
	- Fixed generated scripts to refer to Forms.lookup not Forms.locate.

 4 Dec 2003 -
	- Fixed scripts to pass command line options along.

 3 Dec 2003 (2) -
	- Added build target for bash scripts for running GAfFE generator.

 3 Dec 2003 -
	- Added code to Generator to run persistence-config.js from the main gaffe package.
		- Ensures that the same persistence delegates are used as in the designer.
	- Changed PluginList.findOption to handle null option names.
	- Changed BeanChooser to take a String rather than a DeclName.  Was more convenient, because when
	  creating the State form, though its interface is based on the unprimed state variables, all of the
	  components should have primed names.  Making a String with an added ' is easier than making a 
	  DeclName with an added '.
	- Added an Authenticator inside SpecReaderSource, so that when the JaxbReader tries to fetch the XML
	  schemas from the web, it can get through the authentication on the school's proxy.
	- Made some small fixes to the BasicBeanInterfaceGenerator.
		- Corrected the buttons in the history button panel.
		- Did some work getting forms to come out sized well.
			- Set sizes from preferred sizes.
			- Added border to Forms, even though they won't be saved, they affect the preferred
			  size.
	- Blocked creation of operation output forms when an operation did not produce output.
	- Corrected state form to add prime to all component names.
	- Changed CommandLineSchemaIdentifier to ignore repeated operation schemas.
	- Changed FileInterfaceDestination to allow writing to a file that doesn't exist yet.
	- Used GaffeEncoder rather than XMLEncoder.

28 Nov 2003 -
	- Removed the DOM based interface generator, and bean chooser plugins
	- Set up Generator to use BeanInterfaceGenerator and BeanChooser plugins instead.
	- Changed BeanChooser interface to just return a Component, rather than having the Form, and parent
	  Container passed in.  This no longer causes problems; because, as of 26 Nov, any children of this
	  Component will be added to the Form as well.
	- Changed BeanChooser interface to also take a boolean 'editable' to indicate whether the created 
	  beans are intended for user input or not.
	- Finished, but haven't tested the BasicBeanInterfaceGenerator.
	- Changed one of the checks for stateSchemaName==null in CommandLineSchemaIdentifier to throw an 
	  Error, because command line options should be processed before identifySchema is called.
	- To do:
		- Fix BeanChooser to handle a wider range of type expressions.	e.g. RefExpr.
		- Fix BeanChooser to handle input through tables.	

19 Nov 2003 -
	- Started work on InterfaceGenerator implementation.  May get discarded.
	- Started work on version of the BeanChooser and InterfaceGenerator classes that create the 
	  interfaces, and use XMLEncoder, rather than using DOM.
		- Methods for creating parts of the interface with DOM were becoming lengthy, repetitive, and
		  rather opaque.
	- Added URL parameter for the interface generator plugin, URL indicates location of Z specification.
	- To do:
		- Remove XML DOM based interface generator and bean chooser plugins, change Generator to 
		  account for this.

13 Nov 2003 - (uncommited)
	- Reintroduced BadArgumentsException as BadOptionException.
		- Used by PluginList, and various OptionHandlers to indicate a problem with information
		  received from the plugins.
		- Modified PluginList.processOptions to catch and report BadOptionException.
	- Introduced PluginInstantiationException.
		- Used by PluginList to indicate that for some reason a plugin implementation could not be
		  instantiated.
		- Caught and forwarded as a BadOptionException in many places in PluginList.
	- Added code to run anonymous options (optionName==null) with no argument when option processing has
	  finished.  This way plugins can check that they have been given all the data they need.
	- Fixed Name2String.
		- Wasn't applying itself to Strokes.

12 Nov 2003 -
	- Added javadoc documentation for all files.
	- Added license header to all files.
	- Made 'all' target dependent on 'doc'.
	- Removed the BadArgumentsException class (no longer being used).

 7 Nov 2003 (3) - 
	- Added a plugin for selecting the location to which the interface should be written.

 7 Nov 2003 (2) - 
	- Revamped the command line handling system used by plugins.
		- Introduced Option class for describing a command line option.
		- Introduced PluginList class for handling a collection of plugins, processing a command 
		  line, and for displaying help.

 7 Nov 2003 -
	- Modified classes to be compatible with the new naming scheme for the corejava libraries.
	- Modified the build file to find the new jar files in the corejava libraries.
		- Disabled the available/fail check, was failing because the JAXB libraries weren't in the 
		  classpath.
	- Added help display to Generator
	- Seperated command line argument processing into seperate, more general, utility function in
	  Generator.
	- Added a getArgsDocumentation method to all plugins for use when '-help' is supplied on the command
	  line.
	- Added getStateVariables method to VariableExtractor.
	- Created the DOMInterfaceGenerator plugin class.

29 Oct 2003 - First commit to CVS
	- Package name = net.sourceforge.czt.animation.gui.generation
	- Written as a series of plugins.
		- Plugin interfaces are defined in n.s.c.a.g.g.plugins
		- Plugin implementations are defined in n.s.c.a.g.g.plugins.impl
		- SpecSource - retrieves an AST of a Z specification.
		- SchemaExtractor - finds all of the schemas in the AST.
		- SchemaIdentifier - identifies which schemas are irrelevant, which are state, init, and 
		  operation schemas.
		- VariableExtractor - identifies the relevant variables for input and display in each schema.
		- DOMBeanChooser - decides on an appropriate display/input bean for a given variable, and
		  produces the XML code for the interface.
			- Incomplete.
		- Generator - puts together the bits of interface for each variable to create the whole 
		  interface file.
			- Not yet written.
	- Each plugin provides a method for getting what info it needs from the list of arguments (sourced 
	  from the command line).
	- The implementation used for a particular plugin can be specified on the command line.
	- To do:
		- Write DOMBeanChooser.
		- Instead of having BeanChooser plugin produce XML, have it produce actual beans, use Encoder
		  to write the file???
		- Write Generator(s).
		- Write better implementations of plugins.
