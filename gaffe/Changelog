Changelog:

13 Jun 2003 - Groundwork for having multiple form design windows, + more.
	- Expanded ToolWindow.Tool and its subclasses to include functions for carrying out 
	- Created ToolWindow.SelectBeanTool
	- Created Listener and Event classes for ToolChange, and for BeanSelected
		- used respectively by ToolWindow when a tool is selected, and by FormDesign when a 
		  bean is selected.
	- Modified FormDesign to use 'Tool' provided by ToolWindow (is now a ToolChangeListener) 
	  instead of the BeanInfo tool from its old toolbar.
	- Makefile -  'lib' directory is no longer removed by a 'squeaky' clean.
	- renamed FormDesign.contentPane to FormDesign.beanPane to avoid confusion with RootPane's 
	  contentPane property.
	- Made FormDesign.StatusBar class, instead of using a JLabel for the status bar.
	- Added function FormDesign.addBean, used by ToolWindow.PlaceBeanTool.  Adds a new bean to the
	  form.
	- Discontinued use of MoveHandle (though not deleted yet).
	- Due to moving of responsibilities from FormDesign to DesignCore, it is (at present) not 
	  possible to open the properties window.  This will be fixed in the next commit, when keeping
	  the reference to the properties window, will be managed by the DesignCore.
	- Tasks that need to be done soon:
		- Move the PropertiesWindow to the DesignCore
		- Fix all code that assumes a bean is a component. (Mostly in FormDesign.java).
		- Add the ability to put components inside the Form.
		- Stop non-component beans from going in the Form, stop component beans from going 
		  outside the form.
		- Hack up a fix to make PropertyChangeEvents get sent to the listeners on a component
		  for changes to the 'name' property.  (Components, and possibly other bean types don't
		  trigger a PropertyChangeEvent when the name property changes; this is annoying when
		  we want status bars, etc. to update).
		- Determine if problems are caused by having only the one copy of  the window menu.  Is
		  it permissible to have one menu in two menu bars.  (i.e. the one JMenu object serving
		  two windows).
	
 4 Jun 2003 - (not committed)
	- Moved DesignCore.java to the czt.animation.gui.design package.
	- Created ToolWindow.java in the czt.animation.gui.design package.
		- Created 'resources' directory for holding non .class files destined for the jar file.
	- Modified DesignCore.java to be more than just a shell.
		- Tried BeanContextServices for tracking ToolWindow, PropertiesWindow, ActionMap,
		  InputMap, window JMenu.  Changed to constructor parameters instead.  Becomes overly
		  complicated for this purpose.
		- Keeps track of 'FormDesign's
		- Keeps instance of ToolWindow
	- Eliminated need for temp directory - changed manifest file to be intermediate target.
	- Removed main function in FormDesign.java - used for testing. 

28 May 2003 - Some progress on the properties table:
	- Now uses my TableCellEditor class (PropertiesWindow.PropertyCellEditor).
	- Setting, canceling, etc. work without exceptions.
	- The PropertyCellEditor and PropertiesTable classes need some reworking, there are bits that 
	  may be better if they were moved.  e.g. setting the values in the property editor should
	  probably be done in PropertiesTable.setValueAt instead of PropertyCellEditor.stopCellEditing.
	- At the moment there is a PropertyChangeListener attached to the FormDesign class's form 
	  member to catch changes to the 'name' property, and change the title in its border.  However
	  Components don't seem to call PropertyChangeListeners for the name property!  So, at the 
	  moment, the form's title won't change.
		- This problem is probably shared by the status bar.
	- Needs thorough testing.

27 May 2003 - First commit to CVS:
	- Placing of beans in Form Design window works.
	- Display of properties, methods, and events working.
	- Editing of properties partially working. (Need to sort out stuff between the visual 
	  component, the table it's in, and the property itself.)
	- Before Milestone 0, need:
		- to fix editing of properties completely.
		- ability to link beans via events.
		- ability to work on multiple forms.
		- ability to place component beans visually inside the form being designed.
	- Thoughts:
		- May be desirable to move toolbar into its own window, if there's going to be multiple
		  forms.
		- May want to add seperate tool for moving beans, rather than just click-dragging on 
		  them.  Makes things easier when beans are allowed to be placed inside the form.
