Changelog:


27 May 2003 - First commit to CVS:
	- Placing of beans in Form Design window works.
	- Display of properties, methods, and events working.
	- Editing of properties partially working. (Need to sort out stuff between the visual 
	  component, the table it's in, and the property itself.)
	- Before Milestone 0, need:
		- to fix editing of properties completely.
		- ability to link beans via events.
		- ability to work on multiple forms.
		- ability to place component beans visually inside the form being designed.
	- Thoughts:
		- May be desirable to move toolbar into its own window, if there's going to be multiple
		  forms.
		- May want to add seperate tool for moving beans, rather than just click-dragging on 
		  them.  Makes things easier when beans are allowed to be placed inside the form.
