        - Rename ZFactory in Gaffe to GaffeFactory, updated references.

25 June 2006 -
        - Add ZLiveHistory to connect ZLive. Further changes needed to call ZLiveHistory instead of BasicHistory

                 - Avoid unsafety type convertions
                 - Remove unused imports.
                 - Remove unused declarations.
        - Reimplementing net.sourceforge.czt.animation.gui.temp package as a proxy for ZLive data types
                 - ZValue to Expr add
                   - add General interface for transforming ZValue to Expr 
                 - ZNumber to NumberExpr
                 - ZGiven to ZRefName(GiveValue as the inner expr)
                 - ZTuple to TupleExpr

                 - Add a ZFactory class for transforming Expr to ZValue
                 - Add a UnexpectedTypeException class for catching unexpected types of Expr being transformed
        - Other notes with related packages:
                 - BSF is switched to version 2.2, since 2.3 has a HashTable.get(NULL) exception
                 - Rhino is switched to version 1.5R3, since 1.5R4 is not supported by 2.3 yet, thus not supported by 2.2 neither.
                 - Since gaffe is calling ZLive, it should change the compiling sequence in CZT ant files.
                 - Need OutStrokeImpl in corejava to support getting the string representation of "!"
                  

19 Mar 2004 (2) -
        - Added a copy of my (Nicholas Daley's) Masters thesis to the doc
          folder.

19 Mar 2004 -
        - Combined AnimatorCore and AnimatorCoreBase
                - They were originally separate, because it was thought this
                  would be necessary in order to implement a "scrolling history"
                  interface.  JavaBeans are flexible enough, that a new animator
                  core shouldn't be necessary.
        - Added example interface generated from birthdaybook_unfolded.xml
                - Matches to BirthdayBookFullHistory.
                - See the zml module.

18 Mar 2004 -
        - Removed depend from classes target in build.xml.
                - Should make builds a bit faster.
        - Fixed build.xml to work with new version of czt.properties
                - which now uses rhino.jar, bsf.jar, and not rhino.home,
                  bsf.home.
                - Should still work with the old version too!

09 Mar 2004 - (not committed)
        - Made Event Link Highlighting turned on by default.
        - Made Event Link and Bean Highlighting program wide setting, not per
          window.
                - Need to make the change appear in all copies of the menu.
        - Corrected Bean Highlighting to highlight all beans, not just first
          layer of beans.
        - Now, only those forms that start visible in the animator will start
          visible in the designer.
        - The designer now starts with the toolbox visible.
        - The edit menu on the designer now contains `Delete Current Bean', and
          `Show Properties Window'
        - Changed select tool to react to click, not mouse press.
        - Changed cross cursor (used to indicate an operation is not allowed at
          the current mouse location) to be red.
                - Attracts user attention to the difference from the other
                  cursors.
                - Due to results of usability study.
        - Added checkstyle rules in ./checkstyle/ to check that the license
          header is present in all .java files.
        - Added new version of the BirthdayBookHistory backend
          "BirthdayBookFullHistory", which also handles the non-robust
          operations, so it can be tested with the interface generated from
          birthdaybook_unfolded.xml (See the zml module).
        - TODO:
                - Force highlighting menus to reflect changes to settings.
                        - Possibly use a custom ButtonModel?
                - Make double-click on current bean open properties window?
                        - Difficult, because double-click produces two events.
02 Feb 2004 - (not committed)
        - Changed animator's filechooser to exit the animator if cancel is hit.
16 Jan 2004 - (not committed)
        - Started bringing code style into line with that specified in
          ../devtools/checkstyle.xml
        - Changed BorderEditor's SingleBorderEditors to use instance
          initialisers instead of an init method.
        - Simplified code in FormDesign, PropertiesWindow, and DesignerCore for
          setting up ActionMaps

 8 Jan 2004 -
	- Copied checkstyle rule from corejava into build.xml

 7 Jan 2004 -
	- Modified build.xml to make use of czt.properties.
		- Modified Readme file to account for this.
	- Modified build rules for scripts so that only the scripts rule for the platform will be called.
		- Didn't work before, because dependencies get run regardless of the success or failure of an
		  'if' property on a 'target' element.
	- Added ToDo to doc/ directory.

 5 Dec 2003 (2) -
	- Removed 'run' script, no longer necessary because of the scripts build target.

 5 Dec 2003 -
	- Added 'title' property to Form.  Gets transferred to the window containing it.
	- Added 'startsVisible' property to Form.  Marks whether the Form should be visible when the animator
	  first starts.
	- Modified example interfaces to include title and startsVisible properties as appropriate.
	- Added check when saving interface in designer to stop an interface being saved if no forms have 
	  startsVisible set to true.
	- Modified AnimatorCore to make use of title and startsVisible.
	- Modified AnimatorCore to quit if all forms are closed.
	-To do:
		- Make title appear instead of name on Form's border in the FormDesign window?

 4 Dec 2003 (2) -
	- Changed designer and animator to handle XMLEncoder/Decoder owner property specificationURL.
	- Corrected clearBeans.js to have function clearBeans not fillBeans.
	- Tightened the test GaffeEncoder makes to decide what statements to ignore.
	- Added getPositionLabel to all History classes/interfaces.

 4 Dec 2003 -
	- Fixed scripts to pass command line options along.

 3 Dec 2003 (2) -
	- Added build target for bash scripts for running GAfFE.

 3 Dec 2003 -
	- Pulled all persistence related code from design-config.js out into a new js file 
	  persistence-config.js (because it will also be used by the generator).
	- Resizing of components now calls validate, so that layouts will be readjusted.
	- Pulled the custom XMLEncoder from DesignerCore into a seperate class GaffeEncoder (to also be used
	  by the generator).

28 Nov 2003 -
	- Added two new scripts to the library of scripts:
		- fillHistory - goes through the beans, and inserts their contents into the History.
			- for use by input forms.
		- clearBeans - clears all of the beans on a form.
			- for resetting input forms.
	- Added constructors for Script that take the script and language properties as arguments.

26 Nov 2003 (3) -
	- Removed the Makefiles.  They haven't been kept upto date with the project in a long time.
		- Now it is necessary to use ant instead.
		- Changed the Readme to reflect this.
	- Added a question to the IAQ (5), regarding a particular type of error encountered during building.

26 Nov 2003 (2) -
	- Dropped ObjectDelegate, instead DesignerCore's XMLEncoder overrides writeStatement, and pulls out
	  any that are of the form add*Listener with one parameter whose class is either one of Form's inner
	  classes, or comes from the n.s.c.a.g.design package.
		- I don't like this solution to the problem of the exceptions that are output when saving,
		  but it works and is the least involved.

26 Nov 2003 -
	- Added ContainerListener to Form so that it will notice whenever a Component is added to itself or 
	  one of its Container descendants.  It will then add it as a bean as well.
		- So now to add a component to a Form it can be added via Container's add methods to its 
	          immediate parent. addBean(Component bean, Container parent) is now redundant.
		- The ContainerListener operates appropriately when a Component is removed.
	- Changed FormDelegate removing the code to order the writing of addBean statements, instead only 
	  writing addBeans of non-Components.  Letting the remainder be added via Container's normal add 
	  statements (permissible because of the ContainerListener).
	- Subclassed the XMLEncoder in DesignerCore so that it would use ObjectDelegate instead of 
	  DefaultPersistenceDelegate.
		- This will be removed next commit, because it causes more errors than it solves.
			- If it just replaces all cases, then errors occur with classes like BevelBorder,
			  because they seem to have a custom DefaultPersistenceDelegate (using the String[]
			  constructor) registered.
			- There is no way to get the constructor information out of a 
			  DefaultPersistenceDelegate, so ObjectDelegate cannot replicate the appropriate 
			  behaviour.
			- Most of the relevant methods are protected, so ObjectDelgate cannot wrap 
			  DefaultPersistenceDelegate.
		- At present this may not compile correctly.

24 Nov 2003 -
	- Changed FormDesign so that event listeners don't get set in design mode, only recorded as bean 
	  links.
		- Listeners aren't used in design mode anyway.
		- This way animator and design mode don't need to check if a listener is already registered 
		  with a bean.
	- Changed the example interfaces to remove the redundant add*Listener calls.
	- Introduced ObjectDelegate to act as persistence delegate for all beans.  It removes all listeners
	  from a bean, and then falls back on DefaultPersistenceDelegate's initialize method.  So that it 
	  will not try to write any listeners to the .gaffe file.  Previously, this was resulting in error
	  output appearing when saving, because most listeners on beans were part of the designer, 
	  and weren't designed for persistence.
	- Removed Form's listenerSupport variable (surplus to requirements, because JComponent already 
	  provides listenerList).

20 Nov 2003 -
	- Fixed the FileFilter used for restricting FileChoosers to just .gaffe files to include directories 
	  as well.
	- Added static method to BeanWrapper to find the wrapper for a bean.
	- Modified BeanLink to refer to the two Beans involved, not their wrappers.
	- Fixed the example interfaces to work with the new BeanLink
	- Trimmed unused 'import's from all files.

19 Nov 2003 -
	- Wrote SetModel table model.
	- Moved BeanLink class out from FormDesign into its own file.
	- Added methods to BasicHistory and SolutionSet to give a text description of the current location in
	  their respective lists.
		- For use by the panel of buttons, etc. in an interface for navigating history.
	- To do:
		- Make getPositionLabel part of History interface.

29 Oct 2003 -
	- Modified doc/examples/Readme to not say that AnimatorCore needs modifying; because, since the 
	  examples had the history property on the owner, this is no longer the case.
	- Modified designer to be able to properly handle beans that are nested within JPanels and other 
	  containers.
		- Special treatment is needed in a number of places for JScrollPane, because it doesn't quite
		  work the same as normal Containers.
		- Made a variant of Form.addBean that takes a second property specifying the bean's parent.
		- Select tool will properly step down throgh containers.
		- Make bean tool will create inside the lowest container that was clicked in.
		- Delete bean tool will also delete all child beans of a container.
		- Added JScrollPane and JPanel to the tool window.
	- Because container nested beans are now possible, removed code that wrapped JTables with 
	  JScrollPanes when added to Forms.
		- Modified BirthdayBook example interface to wrap the JTable with a JScrollPane.
	- Added an appropriate FileFilter to the FileChoosers used for loading and saving .gaffe files.
	- Created Util class as place for random little bits.
		- At present just contains the .gaffe FileFilter.
	- Modified RelationModel to not check through everything in the relation to check they're all JTuples
	  of size 2.  Because it should be part of ZSet's invariant that it only take members of the same 
	  type.  Instead it now checks only the first member (if present).
	- Created TupleModel for displaying the contents of a tuple in a table.
	- Created TupleSetModel for displaying the contents of a set of tuples in a table.
	- Modified removeEventLinks... methods to take objects instead of components; i.e. not wrapped by
	  BeanWrapper.  Because it made things easier when deleting a container bean and all of its children.
	- Moved the code that chooses a new current bean when the current bean is deleted to a listener on 
	  the Form.
	- Moved the lowestComponentAt method that appeared in one of the tools in ToolWindow to FormDesign.
	- Modified FormDelegate to handle the changes to addBean.
		- Handles the two argument form of addBean.
		- Sorts the beans retrieved from the form's BeanContext to be in the correct order for adding
		  Container's.  (Before buttons in a JPanel would change order).
	- Started work on the generator.
		- In the generator/ directory.
		- Its Changes will be logged in generator/Changelog
	- To do:
		- Add property editor for LayoutManagers.
		- Remove the code for sorting beans, and instead check if the bean is already a child of its
		  assigned parent component?

 1 Oct 2003 (2) - (uncommited)
	- Modified paragraph in question 4 of Readme.
	  - Interface files made with the designer shouldn't be derivatives.
	  - Interface files that use init script code from the 'library' may be derivatives.

 1 Oct 2003 -Milestone 2 [milestone-2]
	- Tidied the PropertiesWindow and other net.sourceforge.czt.animation.gui.design.properties code.
		- Made the tables package protected.
		- Made classes final, because there is no reason to extend them.
		- Made a number of protected/public members/methods private.
		- Moved the PropertyCellEditor back to PropertiesWindow.

24 Sep 2003 -
	- Added equals, hashCode, and toString  methods to the ZLocators.
	- Modified Form's addBean method so that it will wrap JTables with a JScrollPane.
	- Modified HistoryProxy so that it would only fire ActionEvents for changes in currentSolution, not
	  in currentSolutionSet.
	- Modified FormDesign to put arrows on the displayed bean links.
	- Corrected BirthdayBookHistory to use ZLocators not just Strings when accessing the inputs Map.
	- Added equals, and hashCode methods to the ZValues.
	- Finished the BirthdayBook interface.
		- Involved some direct file modification... see next point.
	- To do:
		- Make sure that the size of the JScrollPane the table gets wrapped in is saved.

22 Sep 2003 -
	- Directly edited the example interfaces so they would set the animator to use the proper back end.
	- Changed design-config.js to make BeanContextChildSupport.beanContext transient.
	- Modified AnimatorCore so that it made use of the BeanLinks, and doesn't rely on these being 
	  provided by the rest of the interface.
	- Made AnimatorCoreBase public.
	- Modified calls to scripts to treat them as anonymous functions.
		- For javascript, code is added to start and end that wraps it as a function.
		- For other languages uses BSFManager.apply (in the current version of BSF, all of the 
		  engines seem to ignore the arguments).
	- Changed FormDesign, and ToolWindow's code that decides when an event link is under the mouse to
	  use ptSegDist instead of ptLineDist.  (ptLineDist pretends that the line goes on forever).
	- To do:
		- Allow interface designer to set the History class to use.

19 Sep 2003 (2) - 
	- Made AnimatorCore public.  Necessary, so that the XMLDecoder can write to its initScript and 
	  initScriptLanguage properties.
	- Changed BirthdayBooke.gaffe to use fillBeans script.
	- Changed Fake.gaffe to use fillBeans script.

19 Sep 2003 -
	- Removed mentions of FormFiller in DesignerCore.java, and design-config.js that would prevent 
	  compilation.

17 Sep 2003 -
	- As a temporary measure (until support for EventHandlers and InvocationHandlers can be added to the 
	  event link tool) added addActionListener and removeActionListener methods to HistoryProxy.
	- Added mechanism for keeping a library of code that can be pasted into the init script from the init
	  script dialog.
	- Removed the FormFiller bean, and created a function fillBeans(form) in the script library that
	  fulfils this purpose.
		- This is preferable, because the functionality of fillBeans can be changed by the interface
		  designer, and it can be ensured that it is done before other script code that is triggered
		  by the history changing.
	- Modified BirthdayBook example to use fillBeans(form).

15 Sep 2003 -
	- Copied example interface that corresponds to FakeHistory class into doc/examples.
	- Started work on making an example interface for the Birthday Book example from 'The Z Notation: A
	  Reference Manual' (Spivey).
		- Several of the following changes are due to necessities discovered making this interface.
	- Made DesignerCore's initialisation script responsible for registering bean classes for the Tool 
	  window.
	- Added property editor for TableModels.  So that tables can be used in interfaces.
		- Wrote table model for bindings, and a table model for relations.
	- Added initialisation script to interface files.
		- Can be edited through the 'Init Script...' entry in the window menu.
		- This would be the appropriate place to declare functions/variables needed by more than one
		  script bean.
		- Uses initScript and initScriptLanguage properties on encoder/decoder owners.
	- Set the designTime property on java.beans.Beans properly.
		- This still needs to be done on BeanContexts.
	- Added lookup function to Form to find beans by name.
	- To FormFiller added code to fill a table if it uses a known table model (e.g. BindingModel).
	- Modified Script to wrap the script in javascript code that will set the thisForm and thisScript 
	  variables.
	- Fixed HistorySupport so it actually creates the inputs Map.
	- Details of ZValue classes were filled in so that they would be usable by BirthdayBookHistory.
		- Note these classes have been made only to fit what was needed as it arised.  They very
		  likely do not have the ideal implementation or API for these classes.
	- To do:
		- Change FormFiller to be a script hooked to from HistoryProxy.  (Common function that can
		  be pasted into the interface init script).
			- Have some general mechanism for pasting code from a library into an interface's
			  init script.
		- Modify Script to work as anonymous function, so that variables are restricted to the scope
		  of one script.  (Global variables/functions can be put in the init script).
		- Write table model that accepts any set of tuples, not just relations.
		- Fix the exception that sometimes arises when writing the interface (due to Encoder trying
		  to encode listeners that are part of the designer, and not meant to be encoded).
		- Fix the delay that sometimes happens with the designer due to the property window looking
		  up editors.
		- Allow scripts to fire events?
		- Allow scripts to daisy-chain?
		- Make all objects in file be written through as properties of the owner?
		- Add a JScrollPane to the JTable bean.  Needed for it to display properly.
		- Rewrite scripts as InvocationHandler or EventHandler, rewrite event link mechanism to allow
		  any event to connect to these via automatically created Proxy.
		- Pass event object that triggered a script through to the script.
		- Write editors and renderers for various classes.  (Insets,LayoutManager,Dimension,
		  Rectangle,Point).

29 Aug 2003 - (not committed)
	- Added method to IntrospectionHelper to fetch editors from PropertyEditorManager, and cache the 
	  results.
		- This was done because PropertyEditorManager.findEditor was significantly slowing creation 
		  of and switching between beans, because of code in PropertiesTable and PropertiesWindow 
		  that used this to decide if a property was editable.
	- Added methods to IntrospectionHelper that take PropertyDescriptor instead of a property name.
		- Because the PropertiesTable code has the PropertyDescriptors already, and its unnecessary
		  work to look it up again by name.
	- Removed propertyDescriptorsEditable vector from PropertiesTable, because now that 
	  IntrospectionHelper is caching editors, this doesn't give a noticable speed-up.
	- Added button to PropertiesWindow for opening a bean's Customiser (if one is provided).
	- Wrote customiser for Script that provides larger (multiline) text area for typing the script.

28 Aug 2003 -
	- Ammendment to Milestone Plan to make mention of Scrolling Animator.
	- Added ResourceIcon, IconEditor, and IconRenderer classes to allow selection and display of Icons in
	  the properties window.
	- Added BorderEditor and BorderRenderer for editing and display of borders in the properties window.
	- Added persistence delegates for URL and ResourceIcon.
	- Modified the layout of ToolWindow slightly. (still needs work).
	- Added option to Filter menu of properties window to filter out non-editable properties.
	- Added code to grey out the rows of non-editable properties - using setEnabled(false).
		- Keep track of editable-ness of properties in a vector, otherwise this becomes slow.
		- Adds a new default renderer for the other two columns.
			- At the moment this is done on a by class basis, can't seem to get the table to pay
			  attention to the column class's renderer.
	- Added a clarification note to the Readme regarding the GPL status of files created using GAfFE.

22 Aug 2003 (2) -
	- Retagged the commit from 13 Aug as milestone-1.
	- Changed the Milestone Plan
		- At this stage gaffe fakes interaction as far as is possible.  Until the animator is
		  done, or at least its API is sorted out not much more can be done towards that.
		- Will do some code tidying, improvement of interface, etc.  then work on interface
		  generation, then on interaction with the animator.
		- Animation history will now be in the first milestone that interacts with the 
		  animator.  Because the design now shows interaction with the animator happening
		  via the SolutionSet and History, so it would be easiest to do it with history.

22 Aug 2003 -
	- Added a PropertyEditor for Color.  (Picked up by PropertiesTable.PropertyCellEditor).
	- Added TableCellRenderers for Color and Font.
	- Tidied up how AnimatorCore set the size of its windows.
	- Removed code from PropertiesTable that wasn't being used (getEditor, and its associated 
	  vectors).
	- Moved PropertyCellEditor from PropertiesWindow to PropertiesTable.
	- Ammended PropertyCellEditor to use PropertiesTable's vector of PropertyDescriptors.
	- Ammended PropertyCellEditor to pop custom editors from PropertyEditor in a dialog, rather
	  than jamming it in the too-small cell.
	- Added PropertyCellRenderer to PropertiesWindow, and mechanism for registering renderers to
	  use with PropertiesWindow.
	- Added the old Milestone Plan to doc/

20 Aug 2003 -
	- Added System.err and System.out to the beans declared with the BSFManager.
	- Modified ${TopDir}/Makefile to not complain if classes/ already exists when it makes it.
	- Modified bean classes that overrode setBeanContext to use a PropertyChangeListener on 
	  themselves instead.
		- This way attributes set on the beanContext property for those classes inherit from
		  their parent.
	- Changed the Script bean to run its script as an anonymous function with the attributes:
		o thisScript - referring to the Script object itself.
		o thisForm   - referring to the Form that the Script object is in.
	  It should be noted that at present the BSFEngines in BSF do not pass these values along to
	  their underlying libraries, so they generally won't be available to scripts, unless this is
	  remedied in BSF.
	- DesignerCore will now run a configuration script from its constructor.
		- It uses java.util.prefs.Preferences to get system and user preferences indicating
		  the location of scripts to run.
		- Preferences are for the net.sourceforge.czt.animation.gui.design package.
		- User preferences can also tell it to ignore System preferences.
		- Both may tell it to ignore the default script stored in the gaffe package.
		- The default script is:
		  resources/net/sourceforge/czt/animation/gui/design/design-config.js
	- design-config.js is used to set attributes in BeanInfos, and set up persistence delegates.
		- This means this code has been removed from the several places it was before.
	- Removed code that was trying to set Form's listeners as being transient, but wasn't achieving
	  anything.
		- Transient seems to only apply to properties, and not to listeners.
	- Added menus, shortcut keys, actions, etc to the PropertiesWindow.
	- Rearranged where the option dialog confirming a decision to quit occurs, so that it will
	  come up regardless of how they quit.
	- Added rememberBeanInfo methods to IntrospectionHelper to keep a central collection of strong 
	  links to BeanInfos.
		- Was being done mostly in FormDesign before.
		- Needed because java.beans only keeps weak references, so modified BeanInfos can 
		  disappear if this is not done.
	- Modified the three table models in the .design.properties package to filter the entries shown
	  based on the hidden, expert, and preferred properties, and the transient attribute on the
	  appropriate FeatureDescriptors.
		- This is controlled by PropertiesWindow from its Filter menu.
	- Added method to IntrospectionHelper to translate names obtained from Class.getName() into 
	  a form more familiar to programmers.
	- Added a little to the Readme about configuration.
	- To do:
		- A configuration window to set the preferences in java.util.prefs' persistent store.
		- Put more work on descriptor attributes set in the config script.
		- Add configuration script on a by project basis? i.e. stored in the saved UI.
		- Store references to the Z specification file, and init schema to the UI file.

15 Aug 2003 (2) -
	- Tidied up lines of code where czt.* changed to net.sourceforge.czt.*.
	- Renamed ScriptDelegate to Script, moved its icon to the same path as the class.

15 Aug 2003 -
	- Renamed packages to net.sourceforge.czt.**.

14 Aug 2003 -
	- Extended SolutionSet and ZValue (sub)classes to contain data.
	- Created FakeHistory which pretends to get data from the animator, but actually fills in phony
	  data for testing (until the animator is ready).  
		- At present it fills each SolutionSet with one Solution containing a ZNumber under
		  the name "value".
	- Created BeanContextServiceProviders for Form and History, and added them as services.
	- Created beans for use in designs that interact with the history object.
		- HistoryProxy forwards the PropertyChangeEvents for "currentSolution" and 
		  "currentSolutionSet".
		- FormFiller catches the PropertyChangeEvent for "currentSolution" and fills in text 
		  fields and labels in the same form by turning their name property into a ZLocator to
		  look up a value.  (Hopefully useful for generated interfaces.)
	- Moved all of the beans intended to be placed in tools into czt.animation.gui.beans.
	- Added fromString function to ZLocator to generate a ZLocator from a string (used by
	  FormFiller).
	- Corrected AnimatorCore's calls to registerBean to use declareBean instead.
	- Modified AnimatorCoreBase.run to skip the FileChooser if a file name was given on the command
	  line.
	- Modified DesignerCore.run to open a file if it was given on the command line.
	- To do:
		- Make History forward SolutionSet PropertyChangeEvents on "currentSolution".
		- Rename packages to net.sourceforge.czt.**.
		- Rename ScriptDelegate to Script to avoid confusion with persistence delegates.
	  Low priority:
		- Modify event link tool to use java.beans.EventHandler if listener type doesn't match.
			- Change ScriptDelegate to not be ActionListener (should work with any type of
			  event thrown at it).
		- Modify event link tool to hook up PropertyChangeListeners on specific properties.

13 Aug 2003 -
	- Added targets to ant build file for compiling with debug info.
	- Started work on AnimatorCore and animate mode.
		- made non-abstract.
		- takes file in constructor.
		- loads interface from file, and displays.
		- registers services with main BeanServicesContext.
	- Removed animateMode property accessors from AnimatorCoreBase, because now design mode is
	  handled by DesignerCore.
	- Wrote run function for AnimatorCoreBase that pops up file chooser, then creates AnimatorCore
	  with the selected file.
	- Added functions to FormDesign for setting various properties to transient.
		- should be moved to persistence delegates?
	- Modified FormDelegate to fake Form.location being transient.
	- Modified ScriptDelegate to be BeanContextServicesListener of its parent context.
		- rename to avoid confusion with persistence delegates?
	- Now at stage where a button can be pushed to trigger a script.
		- (tested with script that outputs to standard output).

 6 Aug 2003 -
	- Some changes to Readme, discussing ant.
	- Added menu option to display GPL.
	- Modified about dialog to display copyright message.

30 Jul 2003 (4) - Tweaked build.xml
	- Fixed up property names to have a standardish form.
	- Fixed up some of the conditions in -init so they'll do what they're meant to.
	- Added a condition to base the location of gaffe.jar on CZTHOME if it is in the environment.

30 Jul 2003 (3) -
	- Added build.xml file for building with ant
	- Modified Makefiles to only need Makefiles in the top directory, src/, and src/'s 
	  subdirectories.
	- Modified Makefiles to remove classes/ from the clean state. (i.e. remove on clean, create on
	  make).
	- Modified some javadoc documentation in FormDesign to reduce warning messages from javadoc.

30 Jul 2003 (2) -
	- Removed unused selectIcon.png, moveIcon.png
	- Deleted commented out move bean tool, and removed moveIcon.gif

30 Jul 2003 - Fixed data lost on last commit
	- Bash scripts used to add license notices to files damaged some.
	- Reverted damaged files to milestone-1-pre-1, and added notices manually.

28 Jul 2003 (2) - Copyright and License notices.
	- Added Copyright and License notice to all files (including comment of images).
	- Added LICENSE file (copy of GPL version 2).

28 Jul 2003 - Milestone 1 Pre 1 [milestone-1-pre-1]
	- Added persistence delegates for Form BeanLink and BeanWrapper.
		- They are all registered via BeanInfo by a static code block in their relevant class.
		- For BeanLink this required some changes to make it a static inner class.
	- Ammendment to BeanWrapper to make it behave sensibly if it doesn't have a bean yet.
	- Added confirm dialog when last FormDesign is closed asking if they want to quit the program.
	- Added confirm dialog when a FormDesign is deleted asking if they are sure.
	- Added code for saving, loading, and importing files.
		- Includes actions in DesignerCore, save and load functions in FormDesign, and delegate
		  classes.
		- Uses java.beans.XMLEncoder and java.beans.XMLDecoder.
	- Added function to IntrospectionHelper to get the known list of listeners for a bean.
	- Modified Readme file to reflect need for J2SDK 1.4.1
	- Todo:
		- Check that the same actions are taken when going through GUI, and loading from file.
		  (Coming from file goes directly to Form's API, via GUI goes through FormDesign).
		- Consider sending FormDesign to file.
		- Find a better way around the issue that listener registration may happen in the file
		  with the source bean, rather than via the BeanLink (results in duplication, and need
		  to check if listeners are registered before registering them).


17 Jul 2003 - Milestone 0 [milestone-0]
	- Retagged as milestone 0.

15 Jul 2003 - Milestone 0 Pre 1 [milestone-0-pre-1]
	- Modified XCursor.gif to produce a better looking cursor.
		- Modified code that reads the gif to check for the system's preferred cursor size.
	- Made PlaceBeanTool use the cross cursor.
	- Added a tool for deleting event links.
	- Added a list of FormDesigns to the Window menu.
	- Added an item to the File menu to delete a FormDesign.
	- Added a listener and event used by DesignerCore when a FormDesign is created or deleted.
		- Used for modifying the entries in the Window menu.
	- Modified code for checking if the mouse was over a highlighted event link to use 
	  java.awt.geom.Line2D.
	- Added flag property to FormDesign that overrides the event link highlighting settings, used
	  by the delete event link tool, so that the links can be seen.
	- Added raiseAction to FormDesign used by the entries in the Window menu for each form.
	- Added actions and key-shortcuts for navigating into containers. - Space, shift Space.
	- Modified the TAB, shift TAB actions to navigate within the current beans parent.

14 Jul 2003 (2) -
	- Fixed small bug that caused the green dragging line to remain when using the Event-Link tool
	  and the mouse was released over an invalid spot.
	- Added tooltip display of what event-link is under the mouse (when said event-link is 
	  highlighted).
		- Odd thing - for getToolTipText(MouseEvent) to be used, setToolTipText(String) has to
		  have been used.

14 Jul 2003 -
	- Rename ResizeHandle to BeanHandle, as it now also manages moving of beans.
	- Added command and entry in the File menu for creating a new form.
	- Altered code in DesignerCore to create a seperate copy of the Window menu for each new 
	  FormDesign, as adding a menu to one menu bar will remove it from another.
	- Made default size for all FormDesigns be set in DesignerCore.createNewForm
	- Changed addBeanSelectedListener to fire off an event to the new listener to stop there being
	  beans in two windows that are selected.
	- Moved the highlighting entries in the View menu to appear in submenus

12 Jul 2003 (2) -
	- Added static getBean function to BeanWrapper, that if given a BeanWrapper unwraps it, but
	  otherwise returns the Component bean it was given.
	- Added equals function to BeanLink in FormDesign.
	- Added code to FormDesign's to the addEventLink and removeEventLink functions to actually 
	  register the listener with the source bean.
		- Also added code to check that the listener was of type listenerType.

12 Jul 2003 -
	- Added paint(Graphics g, FormDesign f) function to ToolWindow.Tool
		- Called by FormDesign.glassPane's paintComponent function.
	- Ammended FormDesign.glassPane's highlight function for event links to use the correct 
	  coordinate space.
	- Ammended some bugs in the event link code in FormDesign that was comparing the component 
	  stored in a BeanLink with the current bean, not the current bean's component.  
		- Caused problems for BeanWrappered beans.
	- Ammended bug in FormDesign.setupActions that was setting highlighting to work on incoming 
	  links when it should have been for outgoing links.
	- Overrode FormDesign.setCursor to only set cursor for its glass pane.
		- Done in order to stop alternative cursors from displaying over the menu/status bars.
		- Not a very nice solution.
	- Used paint function in MakeEventLinkTool to draw line when linking events.
	- Fixed bugs in MakeEventTool causing NullPointerException.
	- MakeEventTool now displays a dialog box asking which listener type the link is for, and 
	  creates the link.
	- Ammended MakeEventTool to switch back to the default tool when finished.
	- Ammended MakeEventTool to set the cursor back to the default cursor when it is unselected.
	- Added Delete shortcut key to delete beans.
	- Made ResizeHandle.setLocation repaint the FormDesign, so that highlighted links would display
	  properly.
	- To do:
		- Add handles for event links?
		- Add ability to delete event links.
		- Add some way to identify the type of an event link.  Tooltext on a handle?

11 Jul 2003 (2) -
	- Modified 'import' headers on all .java files to conform to my preferred style.
	- Changed the glassPane in FormDesign to optionally highlight beans/event links.
	- Added view menu with options for selecting what gets highlighted.
		- Some additions to setupActions, some to setupMenus, also some new protected members
		  for tracking which options are selected.
		- Some of the actions are still lacking shortcut keys.
		- Should put them in sub-menus?
	- Added tracking of event links (not yet used).
		- Also added functions for adding/removing links/groups of links.
	- Changed FormDesign's coordinate translation functions to take a Component instead of a 
	  Container; it will save a cast in a couple of places.
	- Added loading of a 'CrossCursor' cursor in ToolWindow for use by some of the tools.
	- Added a MakeEventLinkTool to ToolWindow, doesn't yet do anything, but most of the work is 
	  edone, cursors look right.

11 Jul 2003 -
	- Forgot to add 'deleteIcon.gif' on the last commit. (added.)

 7 Jul 2003 -
	- Added tool for removing beans.
		- Added removeBean functions to FormDesign and Form.
		- Added property to tools 'oneShot' that is true if the tool should be unselected 
		  immediately after being selected.  i.e. its entire action takes place when the tool
		  is selected.
	- Went back to a handle instead of a tool for moving beans.
		- Integrated with ResizeHandle this time.
		- Commented out everything in ToolWindow related to the MoveBeanTool.
	- Tasks that need doing:
		- possibly renaming the ResizeHandle class to reflect that it also handles moving.
	- Changed highlighting on the selected tool's button in ToolWindow to use BevelBorder, and a 
	  change in colour.
	- Fixed error in ToolWindow.PlaceBeanTool.mouseDragged to use the correct coordinate space (the
	  glass pane's coordinate space, not the bean's parent's).

26 Jun 2003 - Some changes made after suggestions from Mark U.
	- Gave the tool window a title.
	- Changed the PlaceBeanTool to be one shot - ie it switches back to the select tool after 
	  placing one bean.
	- Changed ToolWindow.Tool's default select() and unselect() methods to change the button's 
	  border to a raised EtchedBorder when the tool is selected.

25 Jun 2003 - 
	- Added ability to put beans inheriting from Component in the Form; and the requirement that
	  Components go in the Form, non-Components go outside.
		- Modifications made to ResizeHandle to allow associated components that weren't direct
		  children of the beanPane.
		- Modifications to FormDesign, giving utility functions for translating between 
		  coordinate spaces, check if placement of a bean at a location is permissible.
		- Modifications to ToolWindow's tools to handle multiple levels of Forms.
		- Most of these changes should be forward compatible to the possibility of nested 
		  Forms.
	- Fixed Move tool's cursor to only show over movable object.

23 Jun 2003 (2) -
	- Changed Rules.mk's doc rule to 'mkdir -p' instead of just 'mkdir' the api directory.
	- Blocked the 'doc' directory's makefile from recursing deeper.
	- Added icons for various windows.
	- Added new functions to ToolWindow.Tool - selected, unselected.  Called when tool is selected
	  and in its argument-taking form when a FormDesign learns that the tool is selected.
	- Removed cursor property from ToolWindow.Tool.  Tools can achieve the same effect by setting
	  the cursor on FormDesigns themselves.
	- Added oldTool property to ToolChangeEvent.
	- Made some protected members of ToolWindow private.
	- Added some API documentation.

23 Jun 2003 - False start on inserting components into FormDesign's Form.  
	- See cvs branch pre-milestone-0-false-start-form-insertion

19 Jun 2003 - 
	- Modified lib/Makefile to remove the .tmp file that I presume is made by jar
	- Added ScriptDelegate bean.  A bean (for use in interface designs) that listens for
	  ActionEvents, and uses the BSFServiceProvider service to run a script.
	- Added display of bean type to FormDesign's status bar
	- Corrected FormDesign.setCurrentBeanComponent() to set the status bar with the bean, not the
	  component.  So it will display properly for beans wrapped in a BeanWrapper.
	- Added cursors to tools.
		- At present this is very basic.  Something more complex might be useful; so, for
		  example, the move tool might only have a different cursor when above a bean.
		- Should this be handled by the tool's other functions?
		- Should Tool objects have a method that is called when they are selected?
	- Changed preferred size of tool icons to 32x32 instead of 16x16
	- Commented out code (in FormDesign.java) that quit when a FormDesign is closed.  Added code 
	  (in DesignerCore) that quit when the last window is closed.

17 Jun 2003 - Added tab/shift-tab cycling through beans. + more
	- In FormDesign, made InputMap and AbstractMap 'children' of the DesignerCore's maps.
	- Added "Next Bean"(Tab) and "Previous Bean"(shift Tab) actions to the maps.
		- Tried doing this with FocusTraversalPolicy, just got messy.
	- Blocked any component from taking focus other than the layered pane created in 
	  setupLayeredPanes
	- Added PropertyChangeListeners to make everywhere that a bean's name property appears change
	  when the name property changes.
	- Enabled proper handling of non-component beans (untested)
		- Added a member currentComponent that tracks the component of a bean (either the bean
		  itself or a BeanWrapper).
		- Renamed the setCurrentBean function in FormDesign to setCurrentBeanComponent.  
		  It will unwrap BeanWrappers to set the currentBean member as well.
	- Renamed getCurrentComponent to getCurrentBeanComponent
	- Changed the creation of the Form in FormDesign to use the addBean function.
	- Removed the MoveHandle class, and all references to it. (it was made redundant by the
	  MoveBeanTool a couple of commits ago).
	- Added a nasty hack to PropertiesWindow to send PropertyChangeEvents for the name property
	  that Components don't send themselves.
	- Added functions to IntrospectionHelper for dealing with listeners:
		- providesEventSet returns true if the class can register a given type of listener.
		- addBeanListener registers a given listener of a given type with a given bean.
		- addBeanListener unregisters a given listener of a given type with a given bean.

16 Jun 2003 - Moved PropertiesWindow to the DesignerCore
	- BeanSelectedEvent and BeanSelectedListener are now public types, so they can be used by
	  PropertiesWindow.
	- PropertiesWindow is now a BeanSelectedListener.
	- Removed PropertyChangeSupport from FormDesign, because beanSelectedListeners is now doing its
	  job.
	- Removed setupActions function from FormDesign (wasn't getting called since this was moved to
	  DesignerCore.java).
	- Removed setupToolbar function from FormDesign (was commented out since this was moved to
	  ToolWindow.java).

13 Jun 2003 - Groundwork for having multiple form design windows, + more.
	- Expanded ToolWindow.Tool and its subclasses to include functions for carrying out 
	- Created ToolWindow.SelectBeanTool
	- Created Listener and Event classes for ToolChange, and for BeanSelected
		- used respectively by ToolWindow when a tool is selected, and by FormDesign when a 
		  bean is selected.
	- Modified FormDesign to use 'Tool' provided by ToolWindow (is now a ToolChangeListener) 
	  instead of the BeanInfo tool from its old toolbar.
	- Makefile -  'lib' directory is no longer removed by a 'squeaky' clean.
	- renamed FormDesign.contentPane to FormDesign.beanPane to avoid confusion with RootPane's 
	  contentPane property.
	- Made FormDesign.StatusBar class, instead of using a JLabel for the status bar.
	- Added function FormDesign.addBean, used by ToolWindow.PlaceBeanTool.  Adds a new bean to the
	  form.
	- Discontinued use of MoveHandle (though not deleted yet).
	- Due to moving of responsibilities from FormDesign to DesignerCore, it is (at present) not 
	  possible to open the properties window.  This will be fixed in the next commit, when keeping
	  the reference to the properties window, will be managed by the DesignerCore.
	- Tasks that need to be done soon:
		- Move the PropertiesWindow to the DesignerCore
		- Fix all code that assumes a bean is a component. (Mostly in FormDesign.java).
		- Add the ability to put components inside the Form.
		- Stop non-component beans from going in the Form, stop component beans from going 
		  outside the form.
		- Hack up a fix to make PropertyChangeEvents get sent to the listeners on a component
		  for changes to the 'name' property.  (Components, and possibly other bean types don't
		  trigger a PropertyChangeEvent when the name property changes; this is annoying when
		  we want status bars, etc. to update).
		- Determine if problems are caused by having only the one copy of  the window menu.  Is
		  it permissible to have one menu in two menu bars.  (i.e. the one JMenu object serving
		  two windows).
	
 4 Jun 2003 - (not committed)
	- Moved DesignerCore.java to the czt.animation.gui.design package.
	- Created ToolWindow.java in the czt.animation.gui.design package.
		- Created 'resources' directory for holding non .class files destined for the jar file.
	- Modified DesignerCore.java to be more than just a shell.
		- Tried BeanContextServices for tracking ToolWindow, PropertiesWindow, ActionMap,
		  InputMap, window JMenu.  Changed to constructor parameters instead.  Becomes overly
		  complicated for this purpose.
		- Keeps track of 'FormDesign's
		- Keeps instance of ToolWindow
	- Eliminated need for temp directory - changed manifest file to be intermediate target.
	- Removed main function in FormDesign.java - used for testing. 

28 May 2003 - Some progress on the properties table:
	- Now uses my TableCellEditor class (PropertiesWindow.PropertyCellEditor).
	- Setting, canceling, etc. work without exceptions.
	- The PropertyCellEditor and PropertiesTable classes need some reworking, there are bits that 
	  may be better if they were moved.  e.g. setting the values in the property editor should
	  probably be done in PropertiesTable.setValueAt instead of PropertyCellEditor.stopCellEditing.
	- At the moment there is a PropertyChangeListener attached to the FormDesign class's form 
	  member to catch changes to the 'name' property, and change the title in its border.  However
	  Components don't seem to call PropertyChangeListeners for the name property!  So, at the 
	  moment, the form's title won't change.
		- This problem is probably shared by the status bar.
	- Needs thorough testing.

27 May 2003 - First commit to CVS:
	- Placing of beans in Form Design window works.
	- Display of properties, methods, and events working.
	- Editing of properties partially working. (Need to sort out stuff between the visual 
	  component, the table it's in, and the property itself.)
	- Before Milestone 0, need:
		- to fix editing of properties completely.
		- ability to link beans via events.
		- ability to work on multiple forms.
		- ability to place component beans visually inside the form being designed.
	- Thoughts:
		- May be desirable to move toolbar into its own window, if there's going to be multiple
		  forms.
		- May want to add seperate tool for moving beans, rather than just click-dragging on 
		  them.  Makes things easier when beans are allowed to be placed inside the form.
