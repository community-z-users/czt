Changelog:

28 May 2003 - Some progress on the properties table:
	- Now uses my TableCellEditor class (PropertiesWindow.PropertyCellEditor).
	- Setting, canceling, etc. work without exceptions.
	- The PropertyCellEditor and PropertiesTable classes need some reworking, there are bits that 
	  may be better if they were moved.  e.g. setting the values in the property editor should
	  probably be done in PropertiesTable.setValueAt instead of PropertyCellEditor.stopCellEditing.
	- At the moment there is a PropertyChangeListener attached to the FormDesign class's form 
	  member to catch changes to the 'name' property, and change the title in its border.  However
	  Components don't seem to call PropertyChangeListeners for the name property!  So, at the 
	  moment, the form's title won't change.
		- This problem is probably shared by the status bar.
	- Needs thorough testing.

27 May 2003 - First commit to CVS:
	- Placing of beans in Form Design window works.
	- Display of properties, methods, and events working.
	- Editing of properties partially working. (Need to sort out stuff between the visual 
	  component, the table it's in, and the property itself.)
	- Before Milestone 0, need:
		- to fix editing of properties completely.
		- ability to link beans via events.
		- ability to work on multiple forms.
		- ability to place component beans visually inside the form being designed.
	- Thoughts:
		- May be desirable to move toolbar into its own window, if there's going to be multiple
		  forms.
		- May want to add seperate tool for moving beans, rather than just click-dragging on 
		  them.  Makes things easier when beans are allowed to be placed inside the form.
