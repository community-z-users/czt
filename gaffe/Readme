Configuration
=============
The DesignerCore runs a configuration script when it starts.
Extra or replacement scripts can be configured on a per system/per user basis.
The ability to configure this will be added to the GUI, but at present anyone wishing to do this will
have to find an alternative way to configure this into java.util.prefs' persistent store.

IAQ (Infrequently Asked Questions)
==================================

1. What does GAfFE mean?
------------------------
GAfFE stands for (G)raphical (A)nimator (F)ront(E)nd.  I couldn't think of something for the other f to
stand for.  


2. Building GAfFE with Ant, it complained that it could not find a correct jar file for BSF, or Rhino.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Now obsolete: since 2006 we use Maven to build gaffe.]
To find the BSF and Rhino libraries, build.xml first checks for a bsf.jar.path/rhino.jar.path property 
containing the complete pathname of the jar file.
If there is no *.jar.path property, it checks for a bsf.home/rhino.home property (getting these from 
../czt.properties if not already set).
  bsf.jar.path=${bsf.home}/lib/bsf.jar
  rhino.jar.path=${rhino.home}/js.jar
If there is no *.home property, it tries to get that from a BSFHOME/RHINOHOME environment variable.
  bsf.home=${environment.BSFHOME}
  rhino.home=${environment.RHINOHOME}
If there is no *HOME environment variable, it prompts the user for values for *.jar.path.

It then checks if the values it has found for *.jar.path contain the correct libraries.  If not, it 
complains.

Ways to correct this error:
  1. Add BSFHOME/RHINOHOME variables to the environment.
  2. Provide *.jar.path, or *.home properties on Ant's command line with -D, or in czt.properties.
  3. If these have been done, make sure they are pointing at the correct jar files.


3. What properties can be given to Ant when building GAfFE?
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Now obsolete: since 2006 we use Maven to build gaffe.]
gaffe.source.path    = Where the java files are stored (default src).
gaffe.resources.path = Where the resource (mostly .gif) files are stored (default resources).
gaffe.build.path     = Where to put the compiled .class files (default classes).
gaffe.api.path       = Where to put the javadoc documentation (default doc/api).
gaffe.jar.path       = Where to put the .jar file (default ../${jar.dir}/${gaffe.jar.file}).
gaffe.bin.path       = Where to put the shell scripts for running GAfFE.

jar.dir              = See gaffe.jar.path
gaffe.jar.file       = See gaffe.jar.path
rhino.home           = See Question 2
bsf.home             = See Question 2

4. Are interfaces created using GAfFE derivative works under the GPL?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on my meager understanding of copyright law, files created with the GAfFE interface designer would not
qualify as derivatives.  This may not be the case with interfaces created using the generator, or using init
script code from the 'library'.

However for the sake of having a definitive answer, interface files created by the GAfFE designer, or the
generator should be considered exempt from the GPL's restrictions on derivative works.

What this means is that the files you create are not automatically GPLed, and you may attach any license you
wish to them.

5. The build file tells me that it can't find the correct jar file, but it says
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
it is looking in the right place. What is wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[Now obsolete: since 2006 we use Maven to build gaffe.]
The build file checks that it has the correct .jar file by using it as the classpath, while looking for a class that is known to be in the correct .jar file.
If the jar file location it mentions is pointing at a real jar file, then there are two possibilities.
 - One is that the jar file has the right name, but doesn't contain the right stuff (maybe it's the wrong
   version, maybe it's the wrong package with the write name).  If this is the case, you'll have to find the
   correct package and put it where gaffe's build file can find it.
 - Or, more likely, is that one of the classes that the searched for class depends on can't be found.
   If you run ant with -verbose, it should mention in the output which class it couldn't find.  If this is 
   the case, then you may need to put the library the missing class belongs to where gaffe's build file can
   find it.
   If you're sure it is in the right place, then try commenting out the <fail ...> tag in the build file; it
   will stop the build file complaining, but if the java compiler can't find that class when it comes to be
   its turn, then it will complain then.
