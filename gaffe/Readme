Build Requirements
==================
The following things are needed for building.
1.A Java compiler matching J2SE 1.4
2. either
    Gnu make
	(Not used during development, and not guaranteed to work flawlessly.)
   or preferrably
    Apache Ant
	http://ant.apache.org/
3.The Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) library
	http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf
4.The Rhino library
	http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/

Requirements for use
====================
1.A Java runtime environment matching J2SE 1.4
2.The BSF library
3.The Rhino library

Configuration
=============
The DesignerCore runs a configuration script when it starts.
Extra or replacement scripts can be configured on a per system/per user basis.
The ability to configure this will be added to the GUI, but at present anyone wishing to do this will
have to find an alternative way to configure this into java.util.prefs' persistent store.

IAQ (Infrequently Asked Questions)
==================================

1. What does GAfFE mean?
------------------------
GAfFE stands for (G)raphical (A)nimator (F)ront(E)nd.  I couldn't think of something for the other f to
stand for.  


2. Building GAfFE with Ant, it complained that it could not find a correct jar file for BSF, or Rhino.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To find the BSF and Rhino libraries, build.xml first checks for a bsf.jar.path/rhino.jar.path property 
containing the complete pathname of the jar file.
If there is no *.jar.path property, it checks for a bsf.home/rhino.home property.
  bsf.jar.path=${bsf.home}/lib/bsf.jar
  rhino.jar.path=${rhino.home}/js.jar
If there is no *.home property, it tries to get that from a BSFHOME/RHINOHOME environment variable.
  bsf.home=${environment.BSFHOME}
  rhino.home=${environment.RHINOHOME}
If there is no *HOME environment variable, it prompts the user for values for *.jar.path.

It then checks if the values it has found for *.jar.path contain the correct libraries.  If not, it 
complains.

Ways to correct this error:
  1. Add BSFHOME/RHINOHOME variables to the environment.
  2. Provide *.jar.path, or *.home properties on Ant's command line with -D.
  3. If these have been done, make sure they are pointing at the correct jar files.


3. What properties can be given to Ant when building GAfFE?
-----------------------------------------------------------
gaffe.source.path    = Where the java files are stored (default src).
gaffe.resources.path = Where the resource (mostly .gif) files are stored (default resources).
gaffe.build.path     = Where to put the compiled .class files (default classes).
gaffe.api.path       = Where to put the javadoc documentation (default doc/api).
gaffe.jar.path       = Where to put the .jar file (default ${czt.home}/lib/gaffe.jar or lib/gaffe.jar).

4. Are interfaces created using GAfFE derivative works under the GPL?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on my meager understanding of copyright law, files created with the GAfFE interface designer would not
qualify as derivatives.  This may not be the case with interfaces created using the generator, or using init
script code from the 'library'.

However for the sake of having a definitive answer, interface files created by the GAfFE designer, or the
generator should be considered exempt from the GPL's restrictions on derivative works.

What this means is that the files you create are not automatically GPLed, and you may attach any license you
wish to them.
