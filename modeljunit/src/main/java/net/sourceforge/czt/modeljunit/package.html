    <h1>Model-Based Testing with ModelJUnit</h1>

    <p>
    ModelJUnit is a Java library for model-based testing.  The basic
    idea is that you write an abstract model of your system under test
    (SUT), then you generate lots of tests from that model.
    ModelJUnit is usually used to do <em>online</em> (on-the-fly)
    testing, where the tests are executed on the SUT as they are
    generated.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some advantages of model-based testing are that it can be quicker
    than writing a test suite by hand, can give systematic coverage of
    the behaviours of the model and can make it easier to support
    requirements evolution (update the model and regenerate the
    tests).
    </p>

    <p>
    There are four basic steps to using model-based testing:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Design a model of your SUT.</strong> In ModelJUnit,
         this model is written as a Java class that implements the <a
         href="FsmModel.html">FsmModel</a> interface.  The current
         state of the SUT is modelled by the private data variables
         of this class and the operations of the SUT are modelled by
         the <em>action methods</em> of this class.</li>
      <li><strong>Connect your Model to your SUT.</strong>
         Pass an SUT object into the constructor of your model class.
         Then add code to the action methods of your model so that
         each action method tests one or more of the SUT operations.
         This means that as the automatic test generator traverses
         your model, it will be calling SUT operations and checking
         their results.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate some Tests.</strong>
         Create a test suite by passing one of your model objects
         to a <a href="ModelTestCase.html">ModelTestCase</a> object.
         Then you can generate online (on-the-fly) test sequences of 
         varying length using algorithms such as randomWalk(length).
         </li>
      <li><strong>Analyze any Test Failures.</strong>
         Differences between your model and your SUT are reported
         as test failures.  You should analyze these to determine
         if they are caused by an SUT error, or a model error.
         </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
