Added the class TestingParameter class and IAlgorithmParameter interface.
The TestingParameter is just a structure to store setting from PanelTestDesign
panel.

When user save or load the parameters from a file, different algorithms
have different parameters, that will cause different loading and saving
behavior in different OptionPanel, the solution is using IAlgorithmParameter
interface.

Added ErrorMessage class to pop up a dialog to claim error
I use that class in ModelJUnitGUI class the event handler Run button, if 
user did select test model file or algorithm. The error message dialog will 
pop up.

Change the base class of OptionalPanel from JPanel to OptionPanelAdapter
which implement the IAlgorithmParameter interface, so I could generate 
different code when user choose different algorithm.
