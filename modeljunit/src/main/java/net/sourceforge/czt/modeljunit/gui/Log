--- 12th August 08 ----------------
Added the class TestingParameter class and IAlgorithmParameter interface.
The TestingParameter is just a structure to store setting from PanelTestDesign
panel.

When user save or load the parameters from a file, different algorithms
have different parameters, that will cause different loading and saving
behavior in different OptionPanel, the solution is using IAlgorithmParameter
interface.

Added ErrorMessage class to pop up a dialog to claim error
I use that class in ModelJUnitGUI class the event handler Run button, if 
user did select test model file or algorithm. The error message dialog will 
pop up.

Change the base class of OptionalPanel from JPanel to OptionPanelAdapter
which implement the IAlgorithmParameter interface, so I could generate 
different code when user choose different algorithm.
 
--- 13th August 08 ----------------
Format the code style by using the style from 
https://czt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/czt/trunk/doc/eclipse-code-format-style.xml

Added Indentation class for generate code.

Modified class TestingParameter to Parameter and change it to static class
Clear code delete all System.out.print debug statement. 

--- 14th August 08 ----------------
The project requires files junit.jar (junit3.8.1) and modeljunit.jar now.

Modified the original run button handler, separate it into two functions :
runClass and compileFile.

Added runClass function into ModelJunitGUI, this function uses reflection to 
load and initialize ModelTestCase object and run the test and display result
in a text area.

Have not finished the compileFile function :(

--- 15th August 08 ----------------
Start to change the GUI, added a text area into Result Viewer panel.

[problem 815-1]In the Result viewer panel when user resize the frame, the size of split
panel also changed, but not always, like double click frame to maximize 
the window, the split pane size does not changed.

[solution 815-1]Partial solved, I changed the size of the panel code viewer when user changes frame size. 

[bug 815-2] If user load class file twice, he/she will get duplicate class
exception.

[solution 815-2] Move the class loader be called when user selected model instead of in run event handler.

--- 16th August 08 ----------------
Added border on panels in the test design panel.

Added slider to show the average reset possibility.
Added comboboxes to display verbosity and failure verbosity. 
Modified the Parameter class to store 3 variable (reset possibility, verbosity, failure verbosity).

--- 20th August 08 ----------------
Fixed bug the initial value of reset possibility should bu 0.05 instead of ModelTestCase.DEFAULT_RESET_PROBABILITY
because the minimus value of the slider is 0.05 not ModelTestCase.DEFAULT_RESET_PROBABILITY.
