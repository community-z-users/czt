    <h1>Examples of Using ModelJUnit</h1>

    <p>
    This package contains several examples of ModelJUnit models 
    and test adaptors (the test harness/driver code that links the
    model to the system under test).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>SimpleSet.</strong>  This is a very abstract (simplified)
         model of a set of elements.  To simplify the testing, this model
         assumes that two elements is enough to test the set operations.
         It is only a model (contains no adaptor code), but it could be
         used to generate offline tests.</li>

      <li><strong>SimpleSetWithAdaptor.</strong>
         This is the same as SimpleSet, but the some adaptor code added
         so that it does online testing of a <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code>
         implementation whenever you generate tests from it.
         Pass an SUT object into the constructor of your model class.</li>

      <li><strong>LargeSet.</strong>
         This is a more complex model than SimpleSet, because it models
         up to 13 members of the set independently.  The model is 
         parameterized so that you can create models for any size of set
         from 1 to 13 elements.  However, with 10 elements, this model has
         1024 states and 20480 transitions, which would take a long time
         to test exhaustively.  See SmartSetAdaptor for a better approach.
         </li>

      <li><strong>SmartSetAdaptor.</strong>
         This illustrates how you can use inheritance to add adaptor code.
         This class extends SimpleSet and adds the adaptor code that
         interacts with the SUT (online testing).  It also illustrates how you
         can do abstraction within the adaptor code.  The adaptor code maps
         the model variable <code>s1</code> to a single string (as in
         SimpleSetWithAdaptor), but maps the model variable <code>s2</code>
         to a large number of strings.  This achieves the goal of testing
         the SUT with a large number of elements, but still keeps the model
         small (4 states and 16 transitions) so that it can be tested
         quickly and thoroughly.</li>
    </ul>
