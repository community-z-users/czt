Wed? 21 Dec 2005: 1/2 day
Designed and implemented FlatPredModel with 5 states and 6 actions.  
Found one error, but it was in the test harness part: 
I added something to env_, but forgot to save the result.

Sat 24 Dec 2005: 1 hour
[Plus about 4 hours on the ModelJUnit classes, implementing Action coverage]
Split the chooseModeIII into lots of modes.
Another adaptor error: forgot to use new env after evaluation.
      env_ = pred_.getEnvir();
It takes about 50 random steps to reach 100% Action coverage.

Sat 24 Dec 2005: 2 more hours (about 1/2 hour writing model, rest debugging).
Split the startEval into 1 good-value and 3 bad-value transitions.
Another adaptor error: quite difficult to find (about 1 hour+).
     startEval was assigning the output env to be the current one,
     but in fact, the FlatPred was still using the original input env.
     So this caused the *next* startEval operation to fail one of its
     checks.

Then an IUT error!: with inputs x=2, z=5, there is no solution for y,
but FlatMult returns true (with y=3 I guess).


After that was fixed, I got an x=0 exception, which was expected,
but not by the test adaptor/model.  After trying some other bad
combinations, it became apparent that bad values can have solutions
when non-III modes are used!  The model needs to be parameterized
in some different way!

Model now has 13 Actions and it takes a bit over 200 steps
to reach 100% coverage.
