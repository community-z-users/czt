    <!-- Add new releases here
         Some action types have associated images. By default, images are
         defined for 'add', 'fix', 'remove', 'update' and 'hack'. If you add
         src/documentation/resources/images/<foo>.jpg images, these will
         automatically be used for entries of type <foo>.
         Sample action:
         <action dev="JB" type="fix" due-to="Joe Contributor"
           due-to-email="joec@apache.org" fixes-bug="123">
           Fixed a bug in the Foo class.

      <action dev="Petra" context="fix">
        Improve the operator table so that the rules from Section 8.3
        of the Z standard are followed.  This includes checks that
        a whole operator name is never defined more than once,
        that operators with the same precedence also have the same
        associativity, etc.
      </action>
      <action dev="Petra" type="fix">
        Improve error messages in case a parse error occured
        (compute correct line and column number).
      </action>
      <action dev="Mark, Petra" type="fix">
        Fix the computation of the name of a prefix function like,
        for instance, cardinality.
        Now, the parser does not add a leading space to the name of
        a prefix functions any more.  This closes bug #937623.

      <action dev="Petra" type="fix">
        Write XML files using UTF-8 encoding instead of using the
        locale encoding.  Now the files written when using the
        command line tools zed2zml and ozed2zml with the -out argument
        are in UTF-8.

        Improve the output of schema text so that it generates
	semicolons versus newlines 'correctly'.  Note that LET expressions
	can only contain semicolons, but other schema text can contain
	either.  The choice between semicolon and newline could be done via
        some heuristics, but to do it properly would require recording
        which was used in the input, which requires significant changes
	to the XML schema for Z.
