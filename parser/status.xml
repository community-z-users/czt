    <!-- Add new releases here
         Some action types have associated images. By default, images are
         defined for 'add', 'fix', 'remove', 'update' and 'hack'. If you add
         src/documentation/resources/images/<foo>.jpg images, these will
         automatically be used for entries of type <foo>.
         Sample action:
         <action dev="JB" type="fix" due-to="Joe Contributor"
           due-to-email="joec@apache.org" fixes-bug="123">
           Fixed a bug in the Foo class.
         </action>
    -->
    <release version="1.0" date="unreleased">
      <action dev="Tim, Petra" type="add" context="admin">
        Initial Release.
      </action>

        Implement a visitor that annotates an AST indicating where braces are
        needed to enforce the given priority.  This is needed by printers

        Improve the operator table so that the rules from Section 8.3
        are followed. i.e. If an operator is defined more than once in
        the same scope, it must have the same type, precedence, and
        associativity, two whole operator names can never be the same,
        and operators with the same precedence must also have the same
        associativity.
