% Mark-up directives for core language symbols are as follows:
% The choice for pre, in, or post, has to do with how one wants
% the character to be rendered. See Z Std A.2.3.2.
%
% By using keychars, such as \circguard instead of &, we allow
% appropriate rendering by both LaTeX and Unicode mark-ups.
