 *  Implementation Details:
 *  It uses a (Date, Counter) pair for the time-stamp, where
 *  the Counter is incremented each time one of these TimeStamp
 *  objects is created, to ensure uniqueness.
 *  A Date alone is not precise enough, since it is quite likely
 *  that we will run two commands within the same millisecond.
 *  To avoid int overflow, the Counter is reset to 0 each time
 *  that new Date() returns a new time.
