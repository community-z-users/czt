  Provides classes for parsing Z specifications written in
  unicode or using LaTeX mark-up as defined in the ISO Standard for Z.
  The overall structure of the parser is shown in the following picture:

<p>

<p>
  The {@link net.sourceforge.czt.parser.z.UnicodeParser}
  is responsible for parsing Z specifications written in unicode.
  It consists of an LALR {@link net.sourceforge.czt.parser.z.Parser},
  which gets its input from the
  {@link net.sourceforge.czt.parser.z.UnicodeScanner}.
</p>
<p>
  According to the ISO Standard for Z, the lexis for Z specifications
  consists of two phases: the context-free lexis and the context-sensitive
  lexis.  The {@link net.sourceforge.czt.parser.z.ContextFreeScanner}
  is an implementation of the context-free lexis described in section 7.2
  of the Standard.  The context-free lexis is followed by the context-sensitive
  lexis provided by {@link net.sourceforge.czt.parser.z.KeywordScanner} and
  {@link net.sourceforge.czt.parser.z.OperatorScanner}.  The
  {@link net.sourceforge.czt.parser.z.SmartScanner} resolves some ambiguities
  in the grammer.
</p>
<p>
  The {@link  net.sourceforge.czt.parser.z.LatexParser}
  parses Z specifications in LaTeX.  This is done by first converting
  the latex mark-up into unicode.  Then the UnicodeParser is used to parse
  the specification.  The {@link net.sourceforge.czt.parser.util.CztReader}
  is responsible for preserving the line and column number information of
  the latex document.
</p>
<p>
  The result of a parse is an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation
  of the parsed specification.
  Note that the strings, like for instance operator names,
  used within the AST are provided in unicode independently
  from the input language used (whether unicode or LaTeX).
</p>

<p>
  Limitations and incompatibilities with the ISO Standard for Z:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The parents of a section must either be already parsed (and
    information about it accessible via section info objects), or the
    sections must be provided in the right order, i.e. the parents of
    a section must occur before the section having these parents.
    This makes sure that the parser has access to the operator tables
    (and latex mark-up table in case LaTeX mark-up is parsed)
    of the parents of a section.
  </li>
  <li>
    User defined operators must be defined before they are used.
    This is not standard conforming since according to the standard,
    the scope of an operator template is the whole section in which
    it appears (not only from the operator template onwards).
  </li>
  <li>
    (LaTeX parser only) Latex markup directives must be outside formal
    paragraphs.  Currently they are just ignored inside formal paragraphs.
  </li>
  <li>
    (LaTeX parser only) Latex markup directives must be defined before their
    latex command is used.
    This is not standard conforming since according to the standard,
    the scope of a latex markup directive is the whole section in which
    it appears (not only from the operator template onwards).
  </li>
</ul>
