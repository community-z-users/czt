<p>
Provides classes for printing standard Z specifications in Unicode or
in the LaTeX mark-up language.
</p>

<p>
The Unicode2Latex parser together with the UnicodeScanner can be used
to transform a Z specification written in unicode into a specification
in LaTex without building an intermediate AST.  The class
UnicodeToLatex provides convenience methods and a command line tool
for doing this.
</p>

<p>
An existing AST can be printed using the ZPrintVisitor together with
the ZmlScanner.  The ZPrintVisitor returns a list of Symbols which is
tokenized by the ZmlScanner.  The UnicodePrinter can be used to print
the tokenized specification in unicode, whereas the Unicode2Latex
parser can be used to print the tokenized specification in LaTex.
</p>

<p>
However, in most cases the AST must be preprocessed to get good, or
even useful, results.  The EqualPredVisitor transforms the default
representation of equality to a representation via a relational
operator that can be processed by the ZPrintVisitor.
