% Automata normalisation

%   Distributed disjointness between set of sets.
%   LaTeX used is a bit different from the Unicode given.  U/msa/m/n/10/"47
%   Could not find the same Unicode for the LaTeX chosen. Leave the one below for now.
%   TODO: normalise this for them to match visually.

%   Non-empty regions of a non-empty set of sets.
%   That is, the corresponding set of sets with nondeterminism clearly separated.
%   It is used in the normalisation algorithm for Circus automata.
%   LaTeX char equivalent to \otimes
%%Zprechar \regions U+2A02

%   Calculates the minimal set of a set of sets.
%   That is, the sets that are minimal under subset inclusion.
%   It is used in the normalisation algorithm for Circus automata
%   while calculating minimal sets of coalesced (power) states.
\begin{gendef}[X]
    minimal: \power~(\power~X) \fun \power~(\power~X)

\end{gendef}

%   Set difference distributed over set of sets.
%   It is used for in the operational semantics of parallelism.
%   LaTeX char equivalent to \searrow.
%   The associativity is the same as \setminus.
%   The binding power of this operator template is slightly tigher than \setminus (30).
%%Zinchar \dsetminus U+21F2

\end{gendef}

%   Set intersection distributed over set of sets.
%   It is used for in the operational semantics of parallelism.
%   LaTeX char equivalent to \lozenge(?).
%   Alternative unicode to use U+22C4, which has LaTeX equivalent as \diamond.
%   The associativity is the same as \cap.
%   The binding power of this operator template is slightly tigher than \cap (40).
%   We haven't used 45 because it has already been taken by a \rightassoc operator
%   in sequence_toolkit.tex (\_ \extract \_).
