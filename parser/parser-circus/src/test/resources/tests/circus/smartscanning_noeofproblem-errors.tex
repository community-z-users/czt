Because of the intricate lookahead mechanism for \Circus\ prefixing,
and because of the unfortunate situation that $\circguard$ and $\Semi$
share symbols with the Z tokenizer (for \texttt{ANDASLO} and 
\texttt{ZCOMP} $\semi$), the lookahead mechanism was fooled to think
no ``\Circus'' symbol was found, hence went too far ahead and gave
the ``error location'' at EOF, rather at the occurring point.
\begin{circusaction}
   A \circdef c?x \then (x \leq 0 \circguard \Skip)
\end{circusaction}
This is now fixed by telling the lookahead about those two special cases.
This is not ideal; the ideal would be to have completely disjoint alphabets.
The problem for that is that there is no alternative symbol to ampersand in
Unicode, unfortunately. 

The actual error is the missing $\lcircguard$ parenthesis.
