You must always include the circus\_toolkit, and also check inside
it to see the LaTeX commands the parser recognises (or to create
your own commands)

\begin{zsection}
  \SECTION\ mysection \parents\ circus\_toolkit
\end{zsection}

\begin{axdef}
 maxbuff, maxring : \nat
\end{axdef}

\begin{circus}
 \circchannel\ input, output : \nat
\end{circus}

\begin{circus}
 \circchannel\ write, read : (1 \upto maxring) \cross \nat
\end{circus}

\begin{circus}
 \circchannel\ read\_1 : (1 \upto maxring)
\end{circus}

\begin{circus}
 \circchannel\ read\_2 : \nat
\end{circus}

Unfortunately boxed processes (those spread across multiple
begin/end Circus) are not yet available. You need to define your
processes within one environment only. The only real problem is for
axiomatic definitions (that I am looking into now). Schemas can be
given horizontally.

I know it doesn't typeset nicely. This boxed-process feature will be
available soon. The bottom line is that apart from
