%%Zinword \defs {==}

The next two definitions \textbf{must} be within the \textsf{zeves\_prelude} since it is
included by default in all sections using the ZEves parser. It was previously in the ZEves
toolkit, which is only included if explicitly added.

These are added implicitly because of the use of $applies\$to$ as a decl name and as an 
operators and Latex markup command. This is important to add because otherwise when ZEves
generates VCs containing the predicate (the only time it appears), CZT won't know about 
this name and hence will complain it can't parse what ZEves gives back.
%
%%Zinword applies\$to applies$to
\begin{zed}
   \relation (\_ ~applies\$to~ \_)
\end{zed}

% Don't use \rel to avoid dependency on set_toolkit.tex
\begin{gendef}[X, Y]
   \_ ~applies\$to~ \_ : \power~(\power~(X \cross Y) \cross X)
\where
   \forall R: \power(X \cross Y); x: X @ R ~applies\$to~ x \iff (\exists_1 y: Y @ (x, y) \in R)
\end{gendef}

Similarly, for the $KnownMember$ schema, we add it so that CZT knows about it, yet
we don't send it to ZEves, given it already knows about it.

\begin{schema}{KnownMember}[X]
	element: X
