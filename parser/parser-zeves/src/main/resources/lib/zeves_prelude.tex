% Technically, this should be \znote{... and \Label{... ?
%%Zprechar \znote U+231C
%%Zprechar \Label U+2329

% Dollar sign for special names is interpreted as a LaTeX command (!)
%%Zchar \$ U+0024

% Long-new line for separation within \begin{zed} environments. ZEves doesn't like \\
%%Zchar \also U+000A

% This may create a problem if one inherits fuzz\_toolkit. However, given ZEves is
% already fuzz-compatible, it makes little sense, I guess.
%%Zinword \defs {==}

These are added implicitly because of the use of $applies\$to$ as a decl name and as an 
operators and Latex markup command. This is important to add because
%
%%Zinword applies\$to applies$to
\begin{zed}
   \relation (\_ ~applies\$to~ \_)
\end{zed}

% Don't use \rel to avoid dependency on set_toolkit.tex
\begin{gendef}[X, Y]
   \_ ~applies\$to~ \_ : \power~(\power~(X \cross Y) \cross X)
\where
   \forall R: \power(X \cross Y); x: X @ R ~applies\$to~ x \iff (\exists_1 y: Y @ (x, y) \in R)
\end{gendef}
