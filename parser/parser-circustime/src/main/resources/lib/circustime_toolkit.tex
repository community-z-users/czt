% Like the Z standard toolkit, the Circus time toolkit defines the prelude for the 
% Circus time language, and put in context all Z standard toolkit operators as well as Circus operators.
% In particular the inclusion of circus\_prelude (through the toolkit) is vital for things to work properly.
% 
% The right way to specify user toolkits is to inherit from circustime\_toolkit.
