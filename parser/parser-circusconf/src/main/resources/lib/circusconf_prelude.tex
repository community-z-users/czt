% Like the Z standard prelude, the Circus prelude defines the basic keywords
% and operators for the Circus language. It MUST NOT depend on any other toolkit,
% otherwise a cyclic recursion might occur. The right way to specify user toolkits
% for Circus is to have the circus_prelude or circus_toolkit as a parent.
% circus_toolkit inherits the circus_prelude and standard_toolkit.
