/**
 * A stack of tokens that is initialised with the tokens provided by a scanner.
 *
 * A scanner that returns a stream of tokens can be seen as an
 * iterator, or a stack without #push method.  This class provides a
 * stack view of a scanner that allows pushing tokens back into the
 * token stream.  When initialised with a scanner, the stack contains
 * all the tokens provided by the scanner.  They are returned via the
 * #pop method.  In addition, it is possible to push tokens back into
 * the stream.  This allows, for instance, lookahead and eases the
 * manipulation of token streams.
