As described in the ISO Z standard (Note 4, Section 8.4, p37), the Z
grammar has several ambiguities.  The expression ``i [``
can either turn out to be a generic instantitation:

\begin{zed}
  c1 == i [e1]
\end{zed}

Alternatively, it can turn out to be an application to a schema construction:

\begin{zed}
  c2 == i [e1; e2]
\end{zed}

Here are some more examples:

\begin{zed}
  c3 == x [a, b, c]
\end{zed}

should be a generic instantiation of x.

\begin{zed}
  c4 == x [ a;b;c ]
\end{zed}

and

\begin{zed}
  c5 == x [ a;b;c | true]
\end{zed}

\begin{zed}
  c6 == x [ a;b;c : \nat]
\end{zed}

should be function applications of function x to a set of bindings (a schema).
