From the Z standard chapter 8.3 (User-defined operators):

  "A template can reuse the same words as other templates in the same scope,
   so long as the same token is associated with a word by all templates that
   use that word."

These two operators assign DIFFERENT tokens to 'b' in a single template
%%Zinword \b b

This maps 'b' to both the EL token and the ERE token.
\begin{zed}
\generic 30 \leftassoc (\_ \b \_ \b \_)
\end{zed}
