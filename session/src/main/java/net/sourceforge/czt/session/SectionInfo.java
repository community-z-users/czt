/**
 * A section information (also called <i>section manager</i>) is the central place for storage and
 * computation of CZT information. The computed values are stored in the section manager and can be
 * referred to by subsequent computations.
 * <p>
 * The section manager provides three main functions:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Caching computed values</dt>
 * <dd>Values can be stored in the section manager after calculation, and then can be retrieved via
 * {@link #get(Key)}. Their availability can be checked via {@link #isCached(Key)}.</dd>
 * <dt>Computing values using commands</dt>
 * <dd>The section manager provides a dynamic way of configuring how values are computed. Depending
 * on different dialects, or just configurations, the section manager can use different commands to
 * compute CZT objects. The commands are launched in {@link #get(Key)}, if the requested key is not
 * yet cached.</dd>
 * <dt>Tracking dependencies in a transactional way</dt>
 * <dd>The section manager can track dependencies of computed values, so that when they are removed,
 * the dependencies do not need to be recalculated. To facilitate correct dependency tracking, the
 * section manager employs a transactional model. When a computation of a certain CZT object starts,
 * its transaction should be started (see {@link #startTransaction(Key)}). Then the result value is
 * stored in the section manager by ending the transaction (see
 * {@link #endTransaction(Key, Object, Collection)}). If any problems occur during the computation,
 * the transaction is cancelled (see {@link #cancelTransaction(Key)}).</dd>
 * </dl>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The information is stored in the section manager by using keys, which are a pair of name and
 * value type. The section specific information should be identified by the section name, which
 * should be unique.

  /**
   * Looks up and resolves the {@code key} in the section manager. It never returns {@code null}. If
   * a key is present in the section manager (i.e., {@link #isCached(Key)}= {@code true}), the
   * cached value is returned. Otherwise, a command must be present in the section manager for the
   * indicated key type. It is used to compute the result for the given key and store in the section
   * manager. This value is returned after computation. If any problems during the process occur,
   * the {@link CommandException} is thrown.
   * <p>
   * The commands for different result types are configured dynamically in the section manager. See
   * {@link SectionManager#get(Key)} for details about some core commands and their keys.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Note that when a command is used to compute a result, it may have further calls to
   * {@link #get(Key)}, which would in turn create their own computations. Thus a single call to
   * this method may populate the section manager with a large amount of objects, depending on the
   * the computation dependencies.
   * </p>
   * <h4>Transactions & dependencies</h4>
   * <p>
   * This method is the main entry point to interaction with the section manager. All computations
   * should be done via the section manager commands, which would provide a good transactional
   * environment with clear dependencies. For that reason, this method plays an important part in
   * the default support for section management transactions, and dependency tracking.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * If a result value for the given key is not available in the section manager, a command is used
   * to compute the value. This computation is wrapped in a start-cancel transaction. This means
   * that before the computation starts, a transaction for the {@code key} is started via
   * {@link #startTransaction(Key)}. Next, any exceptions caught during computation force the
   * cancellation of this transaction (see {@link #cancelTransaction(Key)}). Thus for the majority
   * of commands, they only need to end the successful transaction (via
   * {@link #endTransaction(Key, Object, Collection)}), and the starting/cancellation is handled
   * automatically.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * On the other hand, this method is used to track dependencies for existing transactions. A call
   * to {@link #get(Key)} indicates that a computation requires a certain object from the section
   * manager. Thus the computation (and result value) depends on this object. The keys of all calls
   * to {@link #get(Key)} are collected for an existing transaction, and make up its implicit
   * dependencies. These calls may result in their own transactions started, if the value is not
   * computer, creating a nested tree of transactions, where "outer" transactions depend on "inner"
   * transactions and their values. The implicit dependencies are added to the key automatically,
   * when its transaction ends successfully.
   * </p>

  /**
   * Starts a section manager transaction. Adding computed results to a section manager requires a
   * transaction to be started for the result key. The transaction is then used to track
   * dependencies of the calculated value, i.e. what other objects were used to compute the result.
   * <p>
   * The section manager is updated with new results via transactions. So when computing a result to
   * cache in the section manager, a transaction needs to be started first, and then ended by
   * putting the computed result (see {@link #endTransaction(Key, Object)}). Alternatively, if the
   * computation fails, the started transaction needs to be cancelled (see
   * {@link #cancelTransaction(Key)}).
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * The transactional approach to section manager computations allows us to capture implicit
   * dependencies of the computed result. Between the start and end of transaction, all calls to
   * {@link #get(Key)} in the section manager are tracked. E.g. when typechecking a ZSect "foo", the
   * command retrieves the parsed ZSect via {@code #get(new Key<ZSect>("foo", ZSect.class))}, and
   * typecheck results of parent ZSects, among others. These, in turn, will have implicit
   * dependencies on parent sections, etc. All these implicit dependencies through {@link #get(Key)}
   * calls are assigned to the transaction upon its end.
   * </p>
   * <h4>Usage</h4>
   * <p>
   * By default, the implementors of section manager Commands do not need to start the transactions
   * manually. The {@link #get(Key)} method starts the transaction automatically before the command
   * is executed - see {@link #get(Key)} for details. However, in some cases, e.g. when the
   * computations are started on-the-fly (as opposed to via section manager commands, e.g.
   * calculating LatexMarkupFunction during parse), the transactions need to be started by this
   * method (or {@link #ensureTransaction(Key)}). Other cases include postponing a transaction (see
   * {@link #postponeTransaction(Key, Key)}), and then manually starting a transaction in the
   * correct order.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * <strong>Note that if a transaction is started manually, handling of its cancellation upon
   * exceptions needs to be done manually as well. See {@link #cancelTransaction(Key)} for details.
   * </strong>
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * The start/end/cancel transaction functionality supersedes the previous put() style of updating
   * the section manager. The {@link #put(Key, Object)} methods now are just a convenience for
   * starting and immediately ending the transaction.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * In addition to transactions in the section manager, duplicate computations are no longer
   * allowed. This means that a transaction cannot be started if the result has already been cached
   * - it is required to remove the previous result before starting a new transaction. This is
   * necessary to get correct dependencies. During removal of the key, all dependant objects are
   * also cleaned from the section manager.
   * </p>
   * <p>

   * <h4>Usage</h4>
   * <p>
   * Ending of transactions is the main method to use in section manager Commands. When the result
   * is calculated, it should be put into the section manager using this method. In the default
   * case, the starting and cancelling (upon exception) of transaction is handled inside
   * {@link #get(Key)}, thus only ending the transaction is required in the command.

   * </p>
   * <p>
   * For the manually started transactions and exception-cancellation issues, please refer to
   * {@link #startTransaction(Key)} and {@link #cancelTransaction(Key)}.
   * </p>
   * <h4>Dependencies</h4>
   * <p>
   * As outlined in {@link #startTransaction(Key)}, all {@link #get(Key)} calls since the start of
   * transaction are collected as dependencies of this key. So in the case of parsing a ZSect, it
   * will collect dependencies on parent ZSects, its info tables, etc. These, in turn, will collect
   * their own dependencies on their parents, etc. This is achieved by a nesting of start-end of
   * transactions. The dependencies are stored in the section manager, and when one of the
   * dependencies is removed, this key is also (transitively) removed.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * If some of the dependencies cannot be captured implicitly, the {@code explicitDependencies}
   * parameter allows indicating explicit dependencies. The following are several examples of such
   * cases:
   * <dl>
   * <dt>Complex order of transactions</dt>
   * <dd>Due to the complex nature of some commands (especially parsing), we cannot achieve a good
   * nested order of transaction. For example, lexing (and thus computation of LatexMarkupFunction)
   * can happen before the parsing (and computation of a ZSect). Thus we need to explicitly indicate
   * that ZSect depends on its LatexMarkupFunction.</dd>
   * <dt>Bi-directional dependencies</dt>
   * <dd>Section manager objects can be very closely inter-related, and we need bi-directional
   * dependencies. In this case, when one of the pair is removed, the other will be as well. Such
   * cases happen, e.g. for OpTable and its ZSect - the content of operator table is defined as
   * paragraphs of the Z section (OpTable depends on ZSect), however to correctly parse the
   * operators in a section, we need an oparator table (ZSect depends on OpTable). The explicit
   * dependencies allow including bi-directional dependencies.</dd>

   * <p>
   * <strong>Note that cancelling a transaction does not remove successful nested transactions, if

   * </p>
   * <p>
   * As a last resort, {@link #get(Key)} implementations should cancel all nested un-cancelled

   * calculations form the following transaction chain: LMF > ZSect > LMF. A cyclic chain is invalid

   * {@link #postponeTransaction(Key, Key)} method is used to perform this reorder, indicating that

   * postponing the initial transaction, we get ZSect > OpTable.</dd>
   * <dl>
