    <!-- Add new releases here -->
    <release version="1.1" date="unreleased">
      <action dev="Tim" type="update">
        Add a new type of annotation known as a DefinitionUseAnn,
        which is annotated to all *reference* ZNames (that is, ZNames
        inside RefExps) that refers to the declaring name.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="update">
        Add use before declaration functionalty that does not permit
        recursive types. What was previously the use before
        declaration options is now the recursive types option.

      <action dev="Petra" type="update">
        Add a more detailed explanation of the error for the case
        that the hard space is missing between a schema name and
        its decoration.

        Only the left side of freetypes are in scope for mutually
        recursive free types.

        Add recursive operation definitions within the same class paragraph.

        Prevent calls on recursive types in renameUnknownTypes()
      </action>

      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="update">
        Changed the Object-Z typechecker so that only class names can be

      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="update">
        If the signature of an operation cannot be determined due to a

      <!-- Sample action:
      <action dev="JB" type="fix" due-to="Joe Contributor"
          due-to-email="joec@apache.org" fixes-bug="123">

        </action>
      Some action types have associated images. By default, images are
      defined for 'add', 'fix', 'remove', 'update' and 'hack'. If you add
      src/site/resources/images/<foo>.jpg images, these will
      automatically be used for entries of type <foo>. -->
