UnknownType is used when the type of an expression is unknown.
VariableType and VariableSignature is used when a type or signature is
not fully determined. It can be unified with another Type2 object. All
other Type/Term classes in this package are alternate implementations
of their interface. They wrap another implementation of this interface
and hide any references to VariableTypes. Factory provides a factory
for creating these objects.

CloningVisitor does a deep clone on a type object.
