This package consists of several utility classes for
typechecking. The documentation contained in the source files is
sufficient for the simpler classes.
</p>

<p>
The SectTypeEnv class provides convenient methods for adding names
with their section and type to the global type environment. It also
provides a method (which uses the class TypeUpdatingVisitor, also in
this package) for determining references to unknown types once a full
visit to an AST has been performed.
</p>

<p>
The TypeEnv class provides convenient methods for adding names with
their type to the local type environment.
</p>

<p>
The UnificationEnv class provides convenient methods for maintaining a
mapping between a generic/variable type, and the type to which it is
unified in a scope.
</p>

<p>
UnknownType (and its implementation UnknownTypeImpl) are used when the type
of an expression is unknown. It contains a reference to a variable
name if the expression is a reference expression. This aids in
allowing use before declaration.
</p>

<p>
VariableType (and its implementation VariableTypeImpl) are used when
the type of an expression containing a generic type cannot be fulling
instantiated.
