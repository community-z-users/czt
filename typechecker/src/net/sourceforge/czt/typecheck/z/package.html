This package provides two main classes:
</p>

<p>
The first (TypeAnnotatingVisitor) visits an AST and adds type
annotations to the terms in that AST. No error messages are reported
by this class. If a problem occurs attempting to find a type
(e.g. unification fails), no type annotation is added.
</p>

<p>
The second class (TypeChecker) uses the type-annotated AST to perform
typechecking on that AST. This typechecker adds a list of error
annotations (a single annotation is an instance of ErrorAnn)
to the ZSect object being typechecked, as well as adding
individual error annotations to each term that fails the typechecking.
</p>

<p>
The reason for separating the type annotation from the type checking,
and for not producing errors during the type annotation, is to allow
the option of use before declaration.
</p>

<p>
To customise the error messages produced by the typechecker, one can
simply implement the interface called ErrorFactory. Each error message
produces has a corresponding method in this
interface. DefaultErrorFactory is the default class used if no other
implementation is passed to the TypeChecker class.
