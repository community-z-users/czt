Names within a process have local scope. That is, they are contained within the process,
hence can appear across several processes or even globally. They cannot appear within
the same process, though.

\begin{circus}
  \circchannel\ Test0 \\
  \circprocess\ P \circdef \circbegin  \\
  \t1 Test0 \circdef \Stop \\
  \circspot Test0 \circend 
  \also
  \circprocess\ Q \circdef \circbegin \\
   \t1 Test0 \circdef \Skip \\
   \t1 Test0 \circdef \Stop \\
   \circspot \Skip \\
   \circend
\end{circus}
%
In the example above $Test0$ declared as a channel and
within $P$ is well type, but when declared twice within $Q$
a type error arises.
