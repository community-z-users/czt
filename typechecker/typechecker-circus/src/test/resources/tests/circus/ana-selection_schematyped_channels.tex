A \Circus\ program is a sequence of paragraphs just like in Z, but we can
declare channels and processes.  A system is specified in \Circus\ as a
process:~it encapsulates a state, and exhibits some behaviour.
Figure~\ref{figure:identifier-generator} gives a small example.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \setlength{\abovedisplayskip}{0pt}
  \begin{zed}
    [String]
  \end{zed}
  \begin{axdef}
    eS: String
  \end{axdef}
  \begin{schema}{Message}
    priority: \num
    \\ %
    text: String
  \end{schema}
  \begin{circus}
    \circchannel\ inGate, outGate: Message
    \also%
    \circchannel\ ready

    \circprocess\ Buffer \circdef \circbegin
   \end{circus}%
   {\setlength{\zedindent}{2\zedindent}%
     \begin{circusaction}
        \circstate\ BS == [~ q: \seq Message ~]
        \also %
        Init == [~ BS~' | q' = \langle \rangle ~]
      \end{circusaction}
      \begin{schema}{Add}
        \Delta BS
        \\ %
        m?: Message
      \where
        q' = q \cat \langle m? \rangle
      \end{schema}
      \begin{schema}{Out}
        \Delta BS
        \\%
        om!: Message
      \where
        q = \langle \rangle \implies om!.priority = 0 \land om!.text = eS
        \\ %
        q \neq \langle \rangle \implies ((\exists i: 1 \upto \# q @ q\ i = om! \land q' = ((1 \upto i-1) \cup (i+1 \upto \# q)) \extract q \land (\forall j: 1 \upto i-1 @ (q~j).priority < om!.priority))) \land (\forall m: \ran q @ m.priority \leq om!.priority)
