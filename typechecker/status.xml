    <release version="0.4" date="unreleased">
      <action dev="Tim" type="add">
        Implemented implicit downcasting (e.g. a \in B => p)
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="add">
        Improved the error messages reported for relation applications.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Instantiate and check that generic types are instantiated for
        selection expressions that reference a generic definition in a
        class.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="add">
        Add recursive operation definitions within the same class paragraph.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="add">
        Finish type rules for PolyExpr (check that sublasses have the
        type-compatible features).
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Added a method "override" to TypeEnv that is used in downcasting 
        objects, so that downcasting in a scope enrichment is visible to 
        the right-hand-side of the scope enrichment.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Primary variable names declared in a superclass can now be used 
        in delta lists.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Rename primary variable names in rename exprs.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Add functionality to check clashing inherited features.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Add the "self" variable to a class state.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="update">
        Changed the type rule for containment exprs to allow any class
        expression after discussions with Graeme.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Allow type-compatible overriding of attributes and state variables.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Overridden operations have access to the declarations in the
        definition in the superclass.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        No "Init" definition in a class implies init = true. This
        allows "Init" to be selected even if not declared.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Prevent calls on recursive types in renameUnknownTypes()
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="update">
        Implemented a check that names in the visibility list are features 
        of the class.
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="update">
        Changed the Object-Z typechecker so that only class names can be
        inherited, not just arbitrary classes of type ClassRefType. 
      </action>
      <action dev="Tim" type="update">
        If the signature of an operation cannot be determined due to a
        recursive defition, the signature should be empty instead of
        raising an error.
      </action>
     <action  dev="Tim" type="update">
        Improved error message for incompatible Object-Z operation
        inheritance by specifying the inheritance expression.
      </action>
     <action  dev="Tim" type="update">
        Addition of \oid to the Object-Z typing environment.
      </action>
     <action dev="Tim" type="bugfix">
        Conjunction operations and scope enrichments operators both
        allow downcasting within larger operation expressions.
      </action>
      <!-- Sample action:
      <action dev="JB" type="fix" due-to="Joe Contributor"
          due-to-email="joec@apache.org" fixes-bug="123">
          Fixed a bug in the Foo class.
        </action>
      Some action types have associated images. By default, images are
      defined for 'add', 'fix', 'remove', 'update' and 'hack'. If you add
      src/site/resources/images/<foo>.jpg images, these will
      automatically be used for entries of type <foo>. -->
