This package provides utilities for typechecking classes. There are
several classes, all described here.
</p>

<p>
The Checker class is the super class of several other classes (all
other classes ending in Checker). Each of these classes is responsible
for typechecking a different type of Term (e.g. ExprChecker typechecks
Expr objects), adding a type annotation (TypeAnn) to a Term as specified in
the Z standard. If a problem occurs attempting to find a type
(e.g. unification fails), an ErrorAnn object is added instead. The
TypeChecker class is the top-level class (i.e. the one to which the
Spec or ZSect term is passed), and this returns a list of ErrorAnns
for use by other tools.
</p>

<p>
PostChecker is the strangest class. This does "post-checking"
(i.e. typechecking after the entire AST has been visited), for a few
things that cannot be done during AST traversal.
</p>

<p>
TypeCheckUtils provides an interface for calling the typechecker from
within Java programs, as well as a "main" method, which allows
typechecking a file from the command line.
