/** Maintains lower and upper bounds for integer variables.
 *  This is a helper class for the range-inference pass of
 *  ZLive, which deduces lower and upper bounds for integer
 *  variables, based on the semantics of each FlatPred operator.
 *  It also stores information about variables that will bind
 *  to sets, since this can help when deducing bounds of the
 *  elements of those sets.  Bounds information is usually attached
 *  to ZName objects, but other objects that represent parts of
 *  a tuple (x.1) or binding (x.k) can also be used, provided they
 *  are immutable and have sensible equals and hashCode methods.
 *  <p>
 *  It records information about whether new bounds information
 *  has recently (since the last call to startAnalysis)
 *  been added.  The implementation may even record <em>which</em>
 *  variables have recently changed, so that clients can decide
 *  whether or not it is worth re-analyzing a given FlatPred.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *  The enterLocalBounds method can be used to clone a Bounds
 *  object, so that local bounds information can be added to it
 *  without affecting the bounds information in the parent.
 *  This class also counts the number of bounds deductions that
 *  it has detected (see the getDeductions method).  Child Bounds
 *  objects typically add their deduction count to their parent,
 *  so that the count at the root of the Bounds tree gives the
 *  total number of deductions that have been made in the current
 *  pass.  The general idea is to continue making passes until no
 *  further deductions are made in a pass, which shows that a fix-point
 *  has been reached.
