<h1>CZT ZLive Animator</h1>

ZLive provides animation and testing facilities for standard Z
specifications.  It allows simple (finite) expressions, predicates
and schemas to be evaluated.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
ZLive is typically used to test schemas
by supplying concrete values for all the variables in the
schema and asking ZLive to determine whether or not those values
satisfy the schema predicates.  It can also be used to generate
values for some of the variables, and to show all possible solutions
of a schema given values for some of the variables of that schema.
This makes it a useful tool for exploring the behaviour of schemas,
and for experimenting to see if a schema is deterministic (one solution),
non-deterministic (multiple solutions), or unsatisfiable (no solutions).

<h2>Overview of Classes</h2>

<p>
Many users of ZLive will use the text-based user interface provided by the
TextUI class.  This user interface has a 'help' command that lists the most
common commands of that interface, with brief descriptions.
</p>

<p>
Programs that want to animate/evaluate Z terms should use the
ZLive class directly.  This provides the following three main evaluation
methods.  The input terms to these evaluation method must all be parsed and
typechecked before they are passed to ZLive.
<dl>
  <dt>evalPred
  <dd>Evaluates a predicate, returning true, false, or an exception.
  <dt>evalExpr
  <dd>Evaluates an expression and returns another expression that
      contains the evaluation result.  If the input expression defines
      a set, then the result of the evaluation will usually be some
      subclass of the EvalSet interface, which implements the Java
      Set interface and provides lots of methods for querying the size of
      the set and stepping through the members of the set.  Note that,
      unlike Java sets,
      EvalSet objects may contain an infinite number of members, so it is
      usually best to call the estSize() method to learn the approximate
      number of members before calling size(), which will force the whole
      set to be evaluated, so may throw an exception or fail to terminate
      for infinite sets.
  <dt>evalSchema
  <dd>This evaluates a schema with some given inputs/output.
      It is equivalent to calling
      <code>evalExpr(exists binding @ schema)</code> where
      <code>binding</code> (a collection of <code>name==value</code>
      pairs) gives values for some of the variables of the schema.
</dl>
plus a number of getter/setter
pairs for controlling the behaviour of ZLive.
<dl>
  <dt>getMarkup/setMarkup
  <dd>Determines which syntax (LaTeX or Unicode) is used to parse
      and print Z terms.
  <dt>getFactory/setFactory
  <dd>Determines the AST factory used for creating Z terms.
      Unless you are building special kinds of AST with your
      own classes of Z terms, it is best to use the default
      factory rather than calling setFactory.
  <dt>getSectionManager/setSectionManager
  <dd>Determines the section manager that will be used during evaluation.
      The section manager manages the Z specifications that are available,
      so that expressions being evaluated by ZLive can use the names
      defined in those specifications.
  <dt>getGivenSetSize/setGivenSetSize
  <dd>The maximum size of each given set. 
      This is Integer.MAX_VALUE by default, but can be set to a small
      integer if you want to limit the Z specification to use only
      finite/small sets of given values.
  <dt>getCurrentSection/setCurrentSection
  <dd>Determines which section evaluations are being done in.
      If a Z specification contains multiple sections, then
      setCurrentSection can be used to change from one section to another
      so that different names are in scope.
</dl>
