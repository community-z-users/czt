<p>
  Provides classes for managing and caching Z sections, operator tables and
  other Z-related artifacts.  This is important for efficiency.
</p>

<p>
  This directory contains several different designs of section managers.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>SectionManager.java (up to version 1.29) managed four separate
     tables (for ZSect, OpTable, LatexMarkupTable and DefinitionTable)
     and provided methods for generating these when they were not in
     the tables.
   </li>
   
   <li>SectionInfo (interface) and SectionInfoRegistry (an extended
     interface for adding/removing default commands) gave a more abstract
     interface that is capable of storing many kinds of objects.
     
     <p>
     In practice, its first implementation (SimpleSectionInfoRegistry.java)
     only cached ZSect objects, and recomputed the others each time they
     were requested.
     </p>
     
     <p>ToolkitSectionInfoRegistry.java is another implementation
     of SectionInfoRegistry that preloads and caches ONLY the standard toolkit sections.
     It does not allow other ZSects to be added.  
     </p>
     
     <p>WrappedSectionInfoRegistry
     was an experimental implementation of hierarchical section managers,
     which allows ZSects to be added and removed from its cache.  While writing
     this, we found problems with consistency and dependency management, so this
     version was never used.
     </p>
   </li>
   
   <li>The Context interface and its first and last implementation, SectMan 
     (with auxiliary class ContextEntry)
     were based on the chain of responsibility design pattern and the
     idea of starting and committing/aborting transactions.  It maintained
     a generalised cache from Key to Object (where a Key is a String,Class pair).
     It kept a log of changes and could undo them when exceptions were thrown.
     Suffered from all the same problems with consistency and dependency management
     so was never really finished or used.  It also tried to use a String-to-Object
     map to pass arguments from one command to the next, but this turns out to
     be much more clumsy than writing Java code to connect commands together.
   </li>
   
   <li>SectionManager (from version 1.30) is an attempt to be as simple as
   	  possible, to avoid the possibility of one cached entry being out of date
   	  after another has been updated.  It does not allow cache entries to be
   	  changed, or to be removed individually.  Instead, there is a reset method, 
   	  which clears the
   	  whole cache except for the toolkit sections.  It is the responsibility of
   	  the user (eg. the user interface) to call this before re-parsing a file.
   	</li>
