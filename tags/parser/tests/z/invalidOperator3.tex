From the Z standard chapter 8.3 (User-defined operators):

  "A template can reuse the same words as other templates in the same scope,
   so long as the same token is associated with a word by all templates that
   use that word."

These two operators assign DIFFERENT tokens to 'b'.
%%Zinword \a a
%%Zinword \b b
%%Zinword \c c
%%Zinword \d c

This maps 'a' to the EL token and 'b' to the ERE token.
\begin{zed}
\generic 30 \leftassoc (\_ \a \_ \b \_)
\end{zed}

This maps 'c' to the EL token, 'b' to ES and 'd' to ERE.
\begin{zed}
\generic 30 \leftassoc (\_ \c \_ \b \_ \d \_)
\end{zed}
