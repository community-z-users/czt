    <title>Welcome to Corejava</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    <p>
      Corejava is part of the <link href="site:czt">CZT</link>
      project that aims at providing a framework
      for building formal methods tools, especially for the Z specification
      language.  This subproject provides AST (Annotated Syntax Tree)
      classes for Z written in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a Z user and you are looking for existing Z tools, you might be
      more interested in other, more user oriented
      <link href="ext:czt-projects">subprojects of CZT</link>
      (which often use the classes provided here).  If you are a developer of
      Z tools, this might be exactly what you are looking for.
    </p>
    <p>Features are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AST interfaces and classes for standard Z (extensions for
        Object Z and TCOZ are under development)</li>
      <li>Support for the visitor design pattern that allows tools
        to traverse the AST</li>
      <li>XML reader and writer</li>
    </ul>
