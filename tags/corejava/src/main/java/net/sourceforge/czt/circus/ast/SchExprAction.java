/**
 * <p>
        An action given as a schema expression.
        In this way, schema expressions are included into the <code>CircusAction</code> subtree
        in a similar way as schema expressions are included in the declaration and predicate subtrees.
        </p>
        <p>
        As one might use a schema expression for defining a Z schema (i.e. S and T), this class contains an 
        Z <code>Expr</code> instead of <code>SchExpr</code>. The parser is responsible to rule out other 
        possibilities and ensure that only well formed schema expressions are allowed.
        From the CZT these came through <code>SchExpr</code>, <code>SchExpr2</code>, <code>DecorExpr</code>,
        <code>NegExpr</code>, and <code>RenameExpr</code>. (TODO: Check this carefully).
        </p>        
        <p>
        For the process state, this action or a the corresponding Z paragraph must contain a <code>CircusStateAnn</code>.
        </p>
