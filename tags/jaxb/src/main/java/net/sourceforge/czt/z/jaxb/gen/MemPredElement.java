 * &lt;li>Membership predicate.
 * In this case, Mixfix=false, the first (left) expression is the
 * element, and the second (right) expression is the set.
 * For example, "n \in S" has left="n" and right="S".&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>Equality.
 * In this case, Mixfix=true, the first (left) expression is the
 * left-hand side of the equality, and the second (right)
 * expression is a singleton set containing the right-hand side
 * of the equality.
 * For example: "n = m" has left="n" and right="{m}".&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>Other operator application.
 * In this case, Mixfix=true, the first (left) expression is
 * usually a tuple containing the corresponding number of arguments,
 * and the second (right) expression is the operator name.
 * However, for a unary operator, the left expression does not have
 * to be a tuple.
 * For example, "n &amp;lt; m" has left="(n,m)" and right=" _ &amp;lt; _ ",
 * "disjoint s" has left="s" and right="disjoint _ ", and
 * if foo was declared as a unary postfix operator,
 * then "(2,3) foo" would have left= "(2,3)" and right=" _ foo".
 * &lt;/li>
