TODO:
  May03:  Investigate when the Creator/Date/Time attributes disappeared
          from Spec, and decide if we want to retain them.
	  Or should they be done with annotations instead.
	  [DONE added them again]


NOTE: could change OptempPara to use substitution groups, either:
   Token and Operand as subclasses of Foo, or
   L, LP, ES, SS, ... as subclasses of Token
     (this means we need to distinguish Post/Pre/In/No-fix templates)
   (We will see how the parser works after Chunqing has finished,
    before we make this change).




Good XSLT tutorial: http://www.zvon.org/xxl/XSLTreference/Output/index.html

1. Should the DTD use namespaces rather than Z-prefix+Z-colon?
   Yes.

2. Z-PCDATA needs to be defined as an element.  (Done by David Currie)
   We have %Z-PCDATA in %Z-Numeral and %Z-NarrPara
   but #PCDATA used in %Z-Word.    (prefer this one -- avoids extra tag)

	Also, must add <!ELEMENT %Z-PCDATA; (#PCDATA)> to
	David Currie's DTD.

 
3. Why have so many unparsed alternatives?

They must be reflected in the Java AST tree, so are always visible 
to the programmer, which is a pain.  (I imagine that very few tools will 
generate mixes of parsed and unparsed Z).   Allowing every element
of the DTD to have an unparsed alternative triples the number of
Java classes and means that the programmer who is traversing a
AST tree must be constantly checking that each component of the current
node is correctly parsed.

A better alternative might be to only add an unparsed alternative
to each element that is already a choice.  That is:

    Z-Para, Z-Pred, Z-Expr, Z-Decl and perhaps Z-Type

These are the major chunks of the language anyway, so the effect of doing
this would be to simplify the DTD (and the Java AST), at the cost of having
slightly larger 'unparsed' chunks.  For example, if a paragraph contained
several mutually recursive freetypes, and one of them could not be parsed,
you would have to make the whole freetype paragraph unparsed in the XML
file, rather than just one of the freetypes.




4. Should annotations be more flexible (and less context dependent)?

Currently, the XML DTD allows only one annotation per construct,
but that annotation can be overridden to contain multiple kinds of
information.  It is only possible to attach ALL these annotations,
or NONE of them.  For example,...

An alternative would be for each entity to allow (Z-Annotation)*,
so that several annotations can be attached.  Some convention would
be needed about the meaning of having multiple annotations of the
same kind (eg. several type annotations).

A related issue is how strongly 'typed' (or 'context dependent')
the annotations should be.  For example, currently we can define a
completely different set of annotations for the 'true' predicate than
the 'false' predicate.  This seems overkill.  With this system, to
add a new annotation to all kinds of predicates, one must override
about 7 different elements, while to add an expression annotation,
one must override 23 elements.  

However, if we stay with strongly typed annotations, and allow each
annotation to be repeated, then in Java it seems necessary to create
a new subtype of all 23 expr annotations?  Could perhaps be done with
'implements' (if the annotation types are interfaces).


5. Identify subterms by position or by name?
   The substitution group style means we are often using position
   (because the name can be substituted by a subclass name).
   This seems less extensible (harder to ignore added fields in arbitrary places?)

   We could add more names in key places?  
   Eg, <Code> <Then> <Else> tags within CondExpr?



Why not use the XML schema from Singapore?
1. It has a very different structure to Ian's DTD.
   We want to stay close to the DTD, because its design reflects
   the best features from the Z standard abstract syntax, as well
   as from CadiZ and Zeta.
2. It does not make maximum use of commonalities,
   but retains many distinctions from the concrete syntax level 
   (like prefix/postfix).  This makes it quite verbose and complex.
3. It suffers from the 'unnecessary-tag' problem discussed below
   <Expr><Expr><Expr>...</Expr></Expr></Expr>
4. It predefines the prelude operators as enumerations, rather
   than allowing arbitrary unicode (so that alternative preludes
   can be used).  This would probably be easy to change...
5. DeclName and RefName are both just strings?


Notes on new Substitution-Group XML Schema
==========================================

Ian's DTD used 

    <!ENTITY Para (GivenPara|AxPara|FreePara|...)>

to define the allowable alternatives for each construct.  This use of
ENTITY rather than ELEMENT is nice, because it avoids an unnecessary
extra level of <Para>...</Para> tags around every paragraph.  

The obvious way of translating this into XML schema is to use choice
groups:

<xs:complexType name="ParaType">
  <xs:choice>
    <xs:element name="GivenPara" type="GivenParaType"/>
    <xs:element name="AxPara" type="AxParaType"/>
    ....
    <xs:element name="Unparsed" type="xs:string"/>
  </xs:choice>
</xs:complexType>

where the DTD of AxPara (without annotations/attributes etc.)

    <!ELEMENT %Z-AxPara; (((%Z-DeclName;)*, %Z-Sch;)>

becomes this in XML schema:

<xs:complexType name="AxParaType">
   <xs:sequence>
     <xs:element name="DeclName" type="DeclNameType" 
                 minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
     <xs:element name="SchText" type="SchTextType"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

However, this ParaType must be called from an element, which is not
always convenient.  (For example, within Sect, we must define a 
repeated <Para> element, whose type is ParaType.  This introduces
an unnecessary extra level of <Para>..</Para> tags around each
paragraph, like the DTD would if it did not use entities.

So I have used a newish XML Schema feature, `Substitution Groups',
instead, because they seem to more closely match an object-oriented
subclassing structure.  They can support inheritance of attributes
and elements.  They also make it easier to extend the structure (Z
extensions could add a new kind of paragraph simply by defining a new
element with substitutionGroup="Para").  It is also easy to add new
features to one of the subtypes, like AxPara, by declaring a new
element that extends or restricts it and says
substitutionGroup="AxPara" (the substitution relationship is
transitive).  (Technical Note: to make this sort of extension easy, we
need to turn the contents of AxPara into a type, so that the type can
be extended in subclasses).


<xs:element name="Para" abstract="true"/>
<xs:element name="AxPara" substitutionGroup="Para">
  <xs:complexType>
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element name="DeclName" type="DeclNameType" 
                  minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
      <xs:element name="SchText" type="SchTextType"/>
    </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>

One small disadvantage of this approach is that all these elements
must be global (and in XML schema, this seems to mean that a .zml file
could contain just a Para, or an Expr, rather than a Spec!).


The types like SectType and SchTextType are not necessary.
For example, we could unfold SectType inline and
define a SchText element rather than the SchTextType.


To improve readability of the XML schema (and the corresponding Java
classes), it is very tempting to make the names reflect the subtyping
structure more closely: Pred has subtypes PredExpr, PredNeg,
PredLog...  But this <superclass><subclass> style doesn't reflect the
usual English names of the Z constructs (<adjective><noun> style,
which equals <subclass><superclass>)


Only whole paragraphs can be unparsed at the moment.
We could add 'Unparsed...' subclasses to Decl,Pred,Expr,Type etc.
if we want.

DIFFERENCES between Z.xsd and Ian Toyn's Z.dtd
==============================================
I've allowed NAMEs to have annotations (because they inherit TermType).
Similarly for types (which usually appear inside annotations!)

I've made more commonality within binary schema expressions.
Design Issue:  use attributes, or subelements?   Subelements nicer for Java,
        and we do not need to redefine the type of that subelement if
        the structure has not changed...
