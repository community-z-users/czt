Per command kind. ApplyCommand

\begin{theorem}{xyz}
\vdash? \forall x : \nat @ x + 1 \in \nat
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}{abc}[X]
\vdash? \forall x : X; S: \power~X | x \in S @ S \neq \emptyset
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}{qwerty}
\vdash? 10 = 9 + 1

rearrange;
with normalization rewrite;
\end{zproof}

Quantifiers command

\begin{zproof}[qntCmd]
prenex;
instantiate x == 10 + 5, y == \{ a: \nat; b:\nat | P(a,b) \},
    z == 0;
prenex;
\end{zproof}

Simplification command

Susbstitution command

\begin{zed}
   foo == \{ 0, 1 \}
\end{zed}

\begin{zproof}[substCmd]

\end{zproof}

With commands

\begin{zproof}[withCmds]
with predicate (0 \in foo) rewrite;
with expression (foo) reduce;

Combined commands

\begin{zproof}[combinedCmd1]
with normalization
      with
          normalization
              reduce
      ;           % and some comments

% very intricate combined command
with enabled (abc, qwerty, xyz)
  with normalization
    with predicate (0 \in foo)
      prove by reduce;
\end{zproof}

Use command

\begin{zproof}[useCmd]
use qwerty;
use abc[\nat];
use abc[\nat][x := 10, S := \{0, 1\}];
use xyz[x:= 0];
\end{zproof}
