             CZT          Community Z Tools
             ==============================
  
  The Community Z Tools (CZT) project is an open-source Java framework
  for building formal methods tools for Z and Z dialects.  It also
  includes a set of tools for parsing, typechecking, transforming and
  printing standard Z specifications in LaTeX, Unicode and XML
  formats, plus a jEdit plugin which gives WYSIWYG editing of Z
  specifications and buttons for some of the most common CZT tools.
  
  So, you can run the CZT tools via the jEdit plugin (best for new users), 
  or from within a beanshell command prompt (good for programmers).
