This document is the API specification for the annotated syntax tree
(AST) for Z.
</p>

<p>
Z is a specification language used for describing computer-based
systems.  This API describes core interfaces and classes for Z tools
integration.  It is intended to be used by developers of Z tools like
parsers, type checkers, pretty-printers, etc.
</p>

<p>
ZML provides a means of exchanging annotated Z specifications.  This
API provides easy access methods to data in that format.  Included are
interfaces for Standard Z, Object Z, and a Z pattern extension.  The
main features are the possibility to read and write XML documents and
the extended visitor support that enables an application to traverse
an annotated syntax tree.
</p>

<p>
Most package groups have ast, impl, visitor, and jaxb
subpackages.  The subpackage ast provides the AST interfaces.  To get
started, have a look into those packages, especially {@link
net.sourceforge.czt.base.ast} which contains the base interfaces and a
conceptual overview.  The subpackage impl contains an implementation
of the interfaces in ast.  Applications should NOT use those classes
explicitly in order to stay independent of the particular
implementation of the AST interfaces.  Subpackage visitor contains
visitor interfaces.  If you want to write an application that
traverses the tree, have a look into {@link
net.sourceforge.czt.base.visitor}.  Subpackage jaxb provides
classes for reading and writing XML.
