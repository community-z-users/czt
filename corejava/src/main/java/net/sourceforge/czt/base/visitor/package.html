<p>Base visitors for the AST for Z.</p>

<p>The interfaces in this package provide support for the visitor
design pattern.  The purpose of the visitor pattern is to encapsulate
an operation that you want to perform on the elements of the AST for
Z.  In this way, you can provide operations on the AST without the
need of changing the AST classes itself.</p>

<p>Each {@link net.sourceforge.czt.base.ast.Term Z term} accepts a
visitor via the accept-method, which in turn calls the correct visitor
method (double dispatch).  The visitor will then execute its algorithm
for that element.</p>

<p>The AST for Z supports a variant of the so-called default visitor
introduced by <a href="#NorIII">Nordberg</a>.  The default visitor
adds another level of inheritance to the visitor pattern.  It provides
the possibility to implement default behaviour by taking advantage of
the inheritance relationship of the classes to be visited.  This is
achieved by adding visit methods for abstract AST classes as well.</p>

<p>While Nordberg suggests to derive the default visitor from the
standard visitor and to implement all visit-methods in a way that its
default behaviour is to call the visit method for the base class of
the visited class, the AST classes for Z handle that
automatically.</p>

<p>Each AST object, whether abstract or not, has a corresponding
visitor interface that defines the visit method for that object.  If a
visitor implementation wants to visit that object, it has to implement
this interface.  When the accept-method of the AST object is called,
the corresponding visit-method will be executed.  If a visitor does
not implement the visitor interface for an AST object, the
visit-method of the base classes for that object are tried instead,
starting with the base class, followed by the base class of the base
class, etc., untill Term is reached.</p>

<p>The following code provides a visitor that traverses over a tree
of Z terms:</p>
<pre><code>
public class DepthFirstVisitor implements TermVisitor
{
  public Object visitTerm(Term term)
  {
    Object[] children = term.getChildren();
    for (int i=0; i < children.length; i++) {
      if (children[i] instanceof Term) {
        ((Term) children[i]).accept(this);
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the annotations of a term are not
visited by this visitor since they are not returned by the
<code>getChildren</code>-method.</p>
