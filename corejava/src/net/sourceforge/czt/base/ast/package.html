<p>Base interfaces of the AST for Z.</p>

<p>The (Java) AST for Z consists of a set of interfaces whose
inheritance hierarchy can be seen as a tree (the abstract or annotated
syntax tree for Z).  All Z constructs (called terms), provided in the
Z standard package or in one of the Z extension packages, should
extend one of the interfaces provided in this package in a way that
the whole AST interface inheritance hierarchy forms such a tree.  The
inner (non-leaf) interfaces are used for abstract Z constructs like
term, predicate, and expression.  The leaf interfaces represent
concrete Z constructs, like the truth predicate.</p>

<p>Together with the interfaces, which are usually in packages named
net.sourceforge.czt.*.ast, a set of implementation classes is provided
which are located in packages called net.sourceforge.czt.*.impl.
Abstract classes usually implement non-leaf interfaces, whereas
non-abstract classes implement the leaf interfaces, which represent
concrete Z terms.  <emph>It is strongly discouraged to use the
implementation classes in applications explicitly.</emph> Using the
implementation classes explicitly would restricts the application to a
particular set of implementation classes.  An application programmer
should use the interfaces in net.sourceforge.czt.*.ast and the object
factories in order to get AST implementation-independent code.</p>

<p>
To provide an implementation of one of the Z terms, the programmer
needs to implement the corresponding interface.  The new
implementation can extend one of the existing implementation classes
provided in net.sourceforge.czt.*.impl, or can be completely
independend from the implementations provided there.  Special care
must be taken to implement the <code>accept(Visitor)</code> and
<code>getChildren()</code> methods.  These methods are used by all
kinds of AST visitors like type checkers, XML writers, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to the implementation of the Z term, an object factory
should be provided that creates objects of the newly implemented term.
The easiest way to provide a factory method is to overwrite the
corresponding factory method in
net.sourceforge.czt.*.impl.*FactoryImpl to return an instance of the
newly implemented Z construct.
