 * This is a abstract superclass of all the various kinds of

	Each transformation has a left-hand-side (LHS) and a RHS. 
	These terms can contain jokers (JokerExpr/JokerPred).
	Usually, the jokers in RHS should be a subset of those in the LHS,
	otherwise the transformation may not be well defined.
