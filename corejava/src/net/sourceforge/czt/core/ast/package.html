<title>Interfaces for the Abstract Syntax Tree for Standard Z</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Interfaces for the abstract syntax tree (AST) for Standard Z.  See
package {@link net.sourceforge.czt.core.impl} for implementations of all of the
interfaces.
</p>

<p>
These interfaces represent the AST for Standard Z proposed in [<a
href="#ZML">ZML</a>].  The letters and numbers in brackets given
within the interface description refer the corresponding chapters in
[<a href="ZST">ZST</a>] where those Z constructs are discussed in
more detail.
</p>

<p>
Each interface extends at most one other interface of this package so
that the whole interface inheritance hierarchy can be seen as a tree
(abstract syntax tree for Z).  The inner (non-leaf) interfaces are
used for abstract Z constructs like term, predicate, and expression.
They are usually implemented by abstract classes.  The leaf interfaces
represent concrete Z constructs, like the truth predicate, and must be
implemented by non-abstact classes.  The {@link
net.sourceforge.czt.core.ast.ObjectFactory} provides a means of
instantiating concrete Z constructs.
</p>

<p>
To provide an implementation of one of the concrete Z constructs, the
programmer has to implement the corresponding interface and the
corresponding factory methods of the ObjectFactory.  The new
implementation can extend from one of the classes provided in
net.sourceforge.czt.core.impl or can be completely independend from the the
implementations provided there.  The easiest way to provide a factory
method is to overwrite the corresponding factory methods in {@link
net.sourceforge.czt.core.impl.ObjectFactoryImpl} to return an instance of the
differently implemented Z construct.
</p>

<p> Each new Z term (provided by Z extensions) should extend exactly
one of the existing abstract (non-leaf) interfaces provided in this
package.  The <code>accept(AstVisitor)</code> method, which must be
implemented by each concrete Z construct, and is used by all kinds of
visitors like parsers and type checkers, should call
<code>visitFoo(Foo)</code>, where <code>Foo</code> is the interface
from this package from which the new Z construct is extended.  It is
therefore a crucial decision from which interface a new Z term is
extended.  If, for instance, interface <code>Expr</code> is extended,
all visitors will handle this Z construct like an expression.
