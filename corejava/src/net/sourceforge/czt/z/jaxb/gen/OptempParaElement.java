/**
 * An operator template paragraph (C.4.13). This contains a list
 * of at least two Oper elements.  In fact, Oper has two subtypes
 * (Operand and Operator) and the list must alternate between these.
 * In other words, every Operand must be followed by an Operator
 * (unless it is the last element in the list) and every Operator
 * must be followed by an Operand (unless it is the last in the list).
 * For example, an infix operator like '+' would be defined by
 * Operand, Operator with Word="+", Operand.
 * 
 * Java content class for OptempPara element declaration.
 * <p>The following schema fragment specifies the expected content contained within this java content object. (defined at file:/research/projects/gnast/src/xsd/Z.xsd line 205)
