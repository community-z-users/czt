/**
 * This empty class is the base class for all 'official'
        annotations -- those defined for standard Z and the various
	extensions of standard Z.  This gives us the ability to add
        attributes to all such annotations in the future.  However,
        note that the Anns list within each TermA object is not limited
        to just the subclasses of Ann -- arbitrary objects are allowed,
        so that new kinds of annotations can be added without having to
	define them in an XML schema etc.
