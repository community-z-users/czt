corejava_1_1_1
  * change all immutable properties to be mutable since immutable properties
    are no longer needed (they are there for historic reasons)
    => all getter methods that return an immutable list in corejava_1_1_0
       now return a (mutable) list (an example is getDeclName() in AxPara)
    => there are a few more setters now (an example is setName(String)
       in ZSect)
    => there are a few more default factory methods in CoreFactory and
       CoreFactoryImpl (an example is createAxPara())
    => some of the constructors of the implementation classes in package
       have changed; now none of the constructors accepts arguments
       (this should not have influence on applications since these
       constructors are not supposed to be used by applications :-)
    => remove class ImmutableList since it is no longer used

  * add namespace information to the DOM output and write each node
    on its own line (indentation is still missing)
