corejava_1_1_2 [Jan 9, 2004]

  * Add:
    - support for Object Z (based on the Schema provided by Li Yuan Fang)
    - experimental support for Z pattern

  * improved support for the visitor design pattern
    - each AST object has a corresponding visitor interface

  * AST classes now use typesafe lists

  * API Change:
    - Package net.sourceforge.czt.core has been split into package
      net.sourceforge.czt.base containing base classes that are Schema
      independent and package net.sourceforge.czt.z which contains
      the classes representing the AST for Standard Z
      (most of the classes here are generated from the ZML Schema).
    - Rename net.sourceforge.czt.core.ast.CoreFactory to
      net.sourceforge.czt.z.ast.ZFactory and
      net.sourceforge.czt.core.impl.CoreFactoryImpl to
      net.sourceforge.czt.z.impl.ZFactoryImpl to allow a common
      naming schema (Z is now used for the Standard Z classes).
    - Change the order of arguments for some create-methods (for
      instance HideExpr) in ZFactory since the new order is more
      intuitive.
    - Remove class net.sourceforge.czt.core.util.SubstitutionVisitor
      since this sceleton visitor does not meet the needs of all
      possible visitors to be designed.
      A new class net.sourceforge.czt.z.visitor.VisitorUtils is
      provided instead.  This class contains static methods from
      which a programmer can choose when implementing a visitor.

  * JAXB support:
    - JAXB classes are generated using the new JWSDP 1.3

corejava_1_1_1 [Oct 3, 2003]

  * API Change:
    change all immutable properties of the AST classes to be mutable
    since immutable properties are no longer needed
    (they were there for historic reasons)
    => all getter methods that return an immutable list in corejava_1_1_0
       now return a (mutable) list (an example is getDeclName() in AxPara)
    => there are a few more setters now (an example is setName(String)
       in ZSect)
    => there are a few more default factory methods in CoreFactory and
       CoreFactoryImpl (an example is createAxPara())
    => some of the constructors of the implementation classes in package
       have changed; now none of the constructors accepts arguments
       (this should not have influence on applications since these
       constructors are not supposed to be used by applications :-)
    => remove class ImmutableList since it is no longer used

  * add namespace information to the DOM output and write each node
    on its own line (indentation is still missing)

  * use the CLASSPATH environment variable when running the examples
    and tests to avoid NoClassDefFoundError when CLASSPATH is set properly
    but jwsdp.home is not set.
