Welcome to corejava
-------------------

Corejava is part of the CZT project that aims at providing a framework
for building formal methods tools, especially for the Z specification
language.

For more information, please have a look in the doc/ directory, as
well as the CZT web site
http://czt.sourceforge.net/

Here is a description of what each of the top level directories
contains:

build/      This is a temporary build directory.
doc/        This is where the documentation lives.
examples/   This is where the examples live.
src/        This is where all of the source code lives.
tests/      This is where all of the tests live.
            
Requirements
************

- Java 2 SDK 1.4
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/
- Ant
  http://ant.apache.org/
- Java Web Services Developer Pack (JWSDP) 1.2
  http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html
- Junit (only if you want to run the tests)
  www.junit.org
are required to build and run corejava.

If you don't have one of these installed on your system,
you must download and install it to compile the software.

Make sure that ant, java, and javac are in your search path,
and set the property jwsdp.home in the file build.properties to
the home directory of your JWSDP installation.

Compile
*******
Change to the directory where this file is in, and call ant.
By default, ant will build a jar file containing all corejava classes.
Optionally, you can pass one of the following build targets as an
argument to Ant:

	api		- builds the API documentation
	clean		- removes all files generated by build targets
	examples	- builds the example programs and runs them
	jar		- builds the jar
	test		- builds the test cases and runs them
