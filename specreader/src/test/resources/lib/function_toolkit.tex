\ssclause{Partial functions}

\end{zed}

\begin{zed}
X \pfun Y == \{~ f : X \rel Y | \forall p , q : f | p.1 = q.1 @ p.2 = q.2 ~\}
\end{zed}

$X \pfun Y$ is the set of all partial functions from $X$ to $Y$,
that is, the set of all relations between $X$ and $Y$ such that
each $x$ in $X$ is related to at most one $y$ in $Y$.
The terms ``function'' and ``partial function'' are synonymous.

\ssclause{Partial injections}

%%Zinchar \pinj U+2914

\end{zed}

\begin{zed}
X \pinj Y == \{~ f : X \rel Y | \forall p, q : f @ p.1 = q.1 \iff p.2 = q.2 ~\}
\end{zed}

$X \pinj Y$ is the set of partial injections from $X$ to $Y$,
that is, the set of all relations between $X$ and $Y$ such that
each $x$ in $X$ is related to no more than one $y$ in $Y$,
and each $y$ in $Y$ is related to no more than one $x$ in $X$.
The terms ``injection'' and ``partial injection'' are synonymous.

\ssclause{Total injections}

%%Zinchar \inj U+21A3
\begin{zed}
\generic 5 \rightassoc (\_ \inj \_)
\end{zed}

\begin{zed}
X \inj Y == ( X \pinj Y ) \cap ( X \fun Y )
\end{zed}

$X \inj Y$ is the set of total injections from $X$ to $Y$,
that is, the set of injections from $X$ to $Y$
that are also total functions from $X$ to $Y$.

\ssclause{Partial surjections}

\begin{zed}
X \psurj Y == \{~ f : X \pfun Y | \ran f = Y ~\}
\end{zed}

$X \psurj Y$ is the set of partial surjections from $X$ to $Y$,
that is, the set of functions from $X$ to $Y$
whose range is equal to $Y$.
The terms ``surjection'' and ``partial surjection'' are synonymous.

\ssclause{Total surjections}

%%Zinchar \surj U+21A0
\begin{zed}
\generic 5 \rightassoc (\_ \surj \_)
\end{zed}

\begin{zed}
X \surj Y == ( X \psurj Y) \cap ( X \fun Y )
\end{zed}

$X \surj Y$ is the set of total surjections from $X$ to $Y$,
that is, the set of surjections from $X$ to $Y$
that are also total functions from $X$ to $Y$.

\ssclause{Bijections}

\end{zed}

$X \bij Y$ is the set of bijections from $X$ to $Y$,
that is, the set of total surjections from $X$ to $Y$
that are also total injections from $X$ to $Y$.

\ssclause{Finite functions}

%%Zinchar \ffun U+21FB
\begin{zed}
\generic 5 \rightassoc (\_ \ffun \_)
\end{zed}

\begin{zed}
X \ffun Y == (X \pfun Y) \cap \finset (X \cross Y)
\end{zed}

The finite functions from $X$ to $Y$ are the functions from $X$ to $Y$
that are also finite sets.

\ssclause{Finite injections}

%%Zinchar \finj U+2915
\begin{zed}
\generic 5 \rightassoc (\_ \finj \_)
\end{zed}

\begin{zed}

\ssclause{Disjointness}

%%Zpreword \disjoint disjoint
\begin{zed}
\relation (\disjoint \_)

\forall f : L \rel \power X @
\disjoint f \iff ( \forall p , q : f | p \neq q @ p.2 \cap q.2 = \emptyset )
\end{gendef}

A labelled family of sets is disjoint precisely when any
distinct pair yields sets with no members in common.

\ssclause{Partitions}

%%Zinword \partition partition
\begin{zed}
\relation (\_ \partition \_)
\end{zed}

\begin{gendef}[L,X]
\_ \partition \_ : ( L \rel \power X ) \rel \power X
\where
\forall f : L \rel \power X ; a : \power X @
f \partition a \iff \disjoint f \land \bigcup ( \ran f ) = a
\end{gendef}

A labelled family of sets $f$ partitions a set $a$
precisely when $f$ is disjoint and the union of all the sets in $f$
is $a$.
