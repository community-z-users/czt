# Java CUP Parser Generator

This project contains classes of [CUP parser generator for Java][cup-tum].
The CUP parser and lexer are already generated.

This library requires Java CUP Runtime, which is split off the to allow
lighter deployment of generated parsers: they only need to depend on the runtime.

The code is taken from the [CUP TUM][cup-tum] [SVN repository][cup-svn],
corresponding to the released CUP version **0.11a**.
